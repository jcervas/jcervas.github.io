                <p>Your mission is to out-campaign your opponent, who is competing against you to be President.</p>
                <p>Imagine that there are seven competitive states in the <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">NOTUSISTAN</span> Electoral College used for its presidential elections, operating under the same winner take all, weighted voting
                    rules as in the US Electoral
                    College.</p>
                <p>Each player has <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">$100</span> to spend across the seven states, in increments of <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">$1</span> (No decimals or fractions in your numbers are allowed). By
                    directing resources to states, you get a competitive
                    advantage. <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">The initial vote share</span> for each state is 50%, which means that you have an equal probability of winning the state as does your opponent. For every $1 additional spent in a state, you gain an additional 1 percentage point in vote share. For every additional $1 spent by your opponent, you lose 1 percentage point
                    (whoever spends the most money in the state, wins that state).</p>
                <p>For example, <em>State <span class="jc-state-1"></span></em> has <span class="jc-ev-1"></span> electoral votes. If you allocate $<span class="jc-option-1"></span> to the state, and your opponent only allocated $<span class="jc-answer-1"></span>, you win all <span class="jc-ev-1"></span> of <em>State <span class="jc-state-1a"></span>'s</em> EC votes. If instead you allocated $<span class="jc-option-2"></span> to <em>State <span class="jc-state-2"></span></em>, your opponent would win <span class="jc-ev-2"></span> EC votes by
                    allocating anything between $<span class="jc-answer-3"></span> and $100.</p>
                <p>The seven states have Electors shown in the second column. There is a total of 139 EC votes, with <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">70 needed to win</span>.</p>
                <p><span class="jc-highlight highlighted">Ties in each state are decided by coin toss</span>. There is no requirement to allocate any money in a state, or you can spend up to the full amount of campaign funds in just one state.</p>
                <p>You compete against one other person, randomly selected from our database of <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">{{ n_participants }} participants</span>. You win only if you exceed 70 EC votes. </p>
                <p>When you’re ready, <span class="jc-highlight highlighted">enter your state spending totals below</span>. (Until you submit your proposed allocation of campaign spending you can make changes. After you play the game once, you are welcome to do so again by refreshing your browser.)</p>

                        <p><b>Picking a Winning Coalition.</b></p>
                        <p>The Electoral College is a body of electors established by the United States Constitution, which forms every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and an absolute majority of at least 270 electoral votes is required to win the election. According to Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution, each state legislature determines the manner by which its state's electors are chosen. The number of each state's electors is equal to the sum of the state's membership in the Senate and House of Representatives; currently there are 100 senators and 435 representatives.[1][2][3] Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961, provides that the District established pursuant to Article I, Section 8 as the seat of the federal government (see, District of Columbia) is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.[4] U.S. territories are not entitled to any electors.</p>
                        <p>Following the nationwide presidential election day, on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November, each state counts its popular votes according to that state's laws to designate presidential electors. In forty-eight states and D.C., the winner of the plurality of the statewide vote receives all of that state's electors; in Maine and Nebraska, two electors are assigned in this manner and the remaining electors are allocated based on the plurality of votes in each congressional district.[7] States generally require electors to pledge to vote for that state's winner; to avoid faithless electors, most states have adopted various laws to enforce the elector's pledge.[8] Each state's electors meet in their respective state capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday of December to cast their votes.[7] The results are counted by Congress, where they are tabulated in the first week of January before a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives, presided over by the vice president, as president of the Senate.[7][9] Should a majority of votes not be cast for a candidate, the House turns itself into a presidential election session, where one vote is assigned to each of the fifty states. The elected president and vice president are inaugurated on January 20.</p>
                        <p>The suitability of the Electoral College system is a matter of ongoing debate. Supporters of the Electoral College argue that it is fundamental to American federalism, that increases the political influence of small states by the "plus two" Senate count over the number of state Representatives. The geographic dimension of the Electoral College requires candidates to appeal to voters outside large cities. Parties must form national coalitions with moderating appeals, contributing to stability of the two-party system.[10] Presently, a decisive choice for president is made without the challenges and recounts in every state that would follow a nationwide popular vote.[11]</p>
                        <p>because of faithless electors.[12][13] Opponents argue that the system is antithetical to a democracy that strives for a standard of "one person, one vote" because it can thwart a presidential choice by the voters with a national majority.[14] There can be elections where one candidate wins the popular vote but another wins the electoral vote, as in the 2016 election.[15] Individual citizens in less populated states with 5% of the Electoral College, have proportionately more voting power than those in more populous states,[16] and candidates can win by focusing their resources on just a few “swing states”.[17]</p>
