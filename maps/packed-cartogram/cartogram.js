/* Packed cartogram of the United States.
 *
 * Every state keeps its exact outline. Only its SIZE and its POSITION change:
 * each state is scaled about its own centroid so that its area is proportional
 * to the value being mapped, and then the whole set is packed by a physics pass
 * that treats each state as a rigid body and refuses to let any two overlap.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- the method
 *
 * The packing works on circles, not polygons. Each state's outline is resampled
 * at a uniform arc length s, and a circle of radius s/2 sits at every sample.
 * Two facts follow, and between them they are the whole method:
 *
 *   1. Consecutive circles touch -- centres s apart, radii summing to s -- so
 *      the ring of circles is a SEALED wall. Nothing crosses it, however small,
 *      so no state can ever finish up inside another one. This is why boundary
 *      circles alone are enough and the interiors never need filling, which is
 *      what keeps the count near 3,000 instead of near 30,000.
 *
 *   2. The union of those circles is the outline dilated by s/2 -- a Minkowski
 *      sum with a disc. Forbid circles of different states from coming closer
 *      than s + gap and every point of one outline ends up at least `gap` from
 *      every point of the other. Proof: a boundary point p is within s/2 of its
 *      nearest sample a, likewise q and b, so |p-q| >= |a-b| - s = gap.
 *
 * So s is a resolution knob and `gap` is the padding, independently. The padding
 * is not approximated and not merely typical: it is a guaranteed minimum, held
 * uniformly along every border on the map.
 *
 * Because the shapes are never deformed, shape error is zero and area error is
 * zero -- one pixel means the same number of people everywhere on the map, and
 * every state is still exactly its own recognisable self. All of the distortion
 * is absorbed by position, and by the loss of contiguity: the states no longer
 * touch. That is the trade this map makes, and it is the only one it makes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- the solver
 *
 * Position-based relaxation rather than a velocity integrator, because overlaps
 * are projected out directly and so nothing can tunnel through a wall no matter
 * how large the step. Each pass: hash the circles into a uniform grid, push
 * every overlapping cross-state pair apart along its centre line, average each
 * body's corrections into ONE translation (rigid: no rotation either, since a
 * tilted Florida costs more legibility than the packing gains), then pull the
 * body back toward its true geographic centroid.
 *
 * Three things underneath make it work, and each of them replaced something
 * that looked more obvious and did not:
 *
 *   - The layout starts EXPANDED, not small. Scaling every state about its own
 *     centroid pushes neighbours into each other, so the true layout is not a
 *     legal starting point. Growing the states from tiny is the obvious answer
 *     and it is the wrong one: a growing arm sweeps sideways and can close
 *     AROUND a neighbour, and a body that may only translate can never undo
 *     that. Maryland does exactly that to Delaware. So the states are held at
 *     full size and the POSITIONS are pushed apart until nothing overlaps;
 *     gravity then draws them back together. Rigid shapes that only ever
 *     approach cannot interlock -- they meet and stop.
 *
 *   - One pull toward geography, then several projections to pay for it.
 *     Interleaving them one for one lets gravity walk straight back into the
 *     overlap that separation had just resolved.
 *
 *   - The per-body correction is weighted by contact DEPTH, not a flat mean.
 *     This is the one that mattered most. Under a flat mean, a hundred contacts
 *     resting at the padding out-vote the single contact that is genuinely
 *     overlapping, and the deepest contact never clears no matter how long the
 *     solve runs -- which is why every earlier version stalled with a handful
 *     of states permanently touching.
 *
 * Gravity also ramps to zero, so the run ends on pure separation: held constant
 * it fights the separation pass forever and settles at an equilibrium that
 * still contains overlap.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT: this converges at the default settings and across the four
 * measures, but it is not robust at every padding -- a few values leave one or
 * two contacts short of the requested gap. The readout MEASURES the clearance
 * actually achieved rather than assuming it, and says so when it falls short.
 * Trust the number on the page, not the value on the slider.
