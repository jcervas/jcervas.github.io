<div class="cgdoc" markdown="1">

A cartogram where every congressional district is drawn the same size, so the map
shows representation instead of land. Fifty states, 435 districts, and no step
that a person has to do by hand.

The map above is the real geometry the build produces, stepped through stage by
stage — not a diagram of it.

## The shape of it

| Stage | Owned by |
|---|---|
| Boundaries → project → simplify → dissolve | mapshaper |
| Scale each state so its area matches its seats | numeric |
| Place the states so nothing overlaps | numeric |
| Carve each state into one equal-area cell per seat | numeric |
| Match cells to real districts | numeric |
| Write the JSON | numeric |

Anything topological is mapshaper's: projection, simplification, dissolve,
polygon intersection. Everything numerical is base R with no packages beyond what
ships with the language, and is also ported to JavaScript so the whole thing can
be re-solved in a browser.

## 1. Boundaries

Congressional district boundaries, projected to Albers USA, simplified with
Visvalingam weighted at 4%, and dissolved to state outlines. This is the only
stage with an external dependency and the only one that is not re-runnable in the
browser — its output ships as data.

## 2. Scale to seats

Each state is scaled about its own centre so that its **area is proportional to
its seat count**. That is the entire claim the cartogram makes, and everything
downstream has to preserve it.

The scale factor is `sqrt(totalArea × seatShare / stateArea / divisor)`. Wyoming,
with one seat and a great deal of land, shrinks to about a sixth of its size; New
Jersey, with twelve seats in very little land, nearly doubles. Those two numbers
— 0.16× and 1.87× — are worth holding onto, because the spread between them is
what makes placement hard.

## 3. Placement

Now the states overlap, and something has to separate them.

### The collision test is the whole problem

Every reasonable solver does roughly the same thing; what decides the outcome is
**what you call a collision**. Measured on this map at 2 px padding:

| Treating each state as | States that must move |
|---|---|
| a circle | 80 |
| its bounding box | 34 |
| its actual outline | 1 |

A circle around Florida covers most of the Gulf. A box around Idaho covers
Montana. Only the outline knows that Florida's panhandle slots under Alabama, and
the difference is not marginal — it is 80 collisions against one.

So collision is tested on the outlines, sampled: points spaced along every
boundary, each carrying a disc of radius half the padding. Two states are too
close when any two of their discs are. It is exact where it matters and needs no
polygon intersection.

### Two ways to place them

**Hand-drawn slots.** Karim Douieb's original notebook placed all fifty states by
hand in Figma. It is the nicest result on this particular map, because a person
did it — but it is drawn for one particular set of seat counts, and it stops
working as soon as they change. Give every state two seats, as the Senate does,
and Wyoming needs about six times the room its slot allows.

**The free layout**, which needs no hand-drawn layout at all and is the method
the rest of this page describes.

### The free layout

Every state keeps its exact outline. It may be moved and it may be resized, but
it is never bent and never turned — a reader knows a state by its silhouette and
its orientation together, so a tilted Florida costs more than the packing gains.
Area stays exactly proportional to seats by construction, because a uniform
scale is the only thing done to the shape.

Each state is pinned at its own centroid and the whole arrangement is then
spread apart by a factor, so that nothing overlaps to begin with. From there
three rules run together:

- **Separation.** No two discs belonging to different states may come within
  `padding`. Corrections are split between the pair inversely to mass, with mass
  the drawn area, so a large state pulls a small one rather than the two meeting
  in the middle.
- **Gravity.** A decaying pull back toward the true centroid, which is what
  turns a deliberately over-spread arrangement into a compact one.
- **Borders.** Neighbours are sprung to a target distance — their original
  centre spacing, scaled by how much the pair actually resized. If both halve,
  their centres should come half as close.

Three things are worth drawing out.

**The gap is a guarantee, not an average.** Samples sit every `padding/2` along
each outline, so every point of a border is within `padding/4` of one. Forbid
samples of different states from coming closer than `padding` and no two
outlines can finish closer than `padding/2`, anywhere on the map. It is a bound
that falls out of the sampling, not a number that happened to come out of a
solve.

**Springing neighbours to contact would collapse the map.** The obvious link
force pulls each pair toward zero separation; a state with eight neighbours then
takes eight full-strength pulls a pass, and chains of states concertina. Springing
to a *target* distance instead leaves the arrangement free to breathe. The links
also decay more slowly than gravity, because they have further to do: gravity
only has to tighten a layout, while the links have to undo the initial spread.

**The spread is searched, not chosen.** Start from the largest region growth,
since that is what room has to be made for, and escalate until the layout
solves. Then bisect *downward*, because the first spread that works is rarely
the tightest and a looser arrangement refits to a smaller map. On the U.S.
states that takes the packing from 7.3% of the bounding box to 15.9%; at two
seats each, from 1.0% to 6.5%.

### What this gives up

The states no longer touch, and they are no longer quite where geography puts
them. Both are the price of refusing to deform: the space that a bendable state
would have absorbed by changing shape has to go somewhere, and it goes into the
gaps and into the arrangement.

An earlier version of this page packed each state with a lattice of circles and
carried the outline back through it, which filled the frame more tightly and let
states interlock the way real borders do. It was dropped for this. Deforming the
outline is a large amount of machinery — shape matching, an annealed shape
constraint, a deformation cage, border anchors — spent on making the distortion
*look* acceptable, and it still left every state subtly the wrong shape. Moving
a state is honest in a way that bending it is not: here the shape error is zero
and the area error is zero, and everything that is wrong with the map is wrong
in a way the reader can see.


## 4. Carve into cells

Each state is subdivided into as many cells as it has seats, and the cells must
come out roughly **equal in area** — a district's cell should carry the same
visual weight whether it covers half of Montana or six blocks of Manhattan.

1. **Sample.** Scatter uniform random points across the state, 600 per seat.
   Points are allocated between a state's parts in proportion to area, so islands
   and peninsulas get their share. This is the only randomness in the pipeline
   and it is seeded, so a rebuild reproduces the same cells exactly.
2. **Cluster.** k-means on a *uniform* point cloud is the trick: because the
   points are spread evenly over the area, clusters holding an equal number of
   points are clusters holding an equal amount of **area**.
3. **Balance.** k-means equalises variance, not area, and in an awkward shape
   those come apart badly — Florida's largest cell ends up 4.8× its smallest.
   Alternating a Lloyd step with a capacity step turns the Voronoi diagram into a
   power diagram and brings that to 1.15×.
4. **Clip** to the state outline.

Because the sample points lie *inside* the state, the count a site captures is a
Monte-Carlo estimate of its cell's area **after** clipping — which is the area
that actually matters. Measuring the raw cell polygons instead reports ~17× for
both methods and hides the whole effect.

Across all fifty states the worst within-state area ratio falls from 5.53 to
1.24, and the median from 1.38 to 1.11.

## 5. Match cells to districts

Carving gives the right *number* of cells but says nothing about which cell
belongs to which district. Something has to pair them, and the pairing is what
the morph animates along.

Pair each district with exactly one cell so that the **total squared distance**
between their centres is as small as possible. That is a linear assignment
problem. Greedy pairing is not optimal and the failure is visible: one district
gets stranded and has to cross the state to reach the last free cell. The optimum
is found exactly by the Hungarian algorithm — about sixty lines, no packages.

Squaring penalises one long journey more than several short ones, so the optimum
spreads the displacement around rather than accepting a single state-crossing
move.

## 6. In the browser

The whole numerical half is ported to JavaScript, so the cartogram can be
re-solved live rather than only read back from a finished file. Try it in
[the studio](https://jonathancervas.com/maps/cartogram-studio/): change the
padding, the state size, the seat counts or the geography and watch it re-solve.

Only the numerical stages moved. Projection, simplification and dissolve stay
with mapshaper and ship as data. Clipping the cells to the state — the one
genuinely hard piece of geometry — is done by the browser at paint time with an
SVG `clipPath`, which is why the page needs no polygon-clipping library.

It will not reproduce the R build pixel for pixel, and cannot. The separation is
a Gauss–Seidel iteration, which is chaotic: a 10⁻¹³ floating-point difference in
the first sweep grows by roughly a factor of ten per iteration, so after a
hundred it is a few pixels. What survives is the invariant, which is the thing
worth guaranteeing — no two states closer than the padding, and an optimal
assignment.

## How it is checked

The port is verified against the R build on every run. It cannot compare
geometry, because R's RNG is not reproducible in JavaScript, so it compares
properties — sixty checks, of which the ones that carry the most weight are:

- The ported Hungarian, handed the R build's own cells, returns the identity
  assignment at the identical cost. That is the strongest statement available
  without matching floating point.
- The separation, started from the layout R shipped, finds nothing to move: the
  two implementations agree on what "legal" means.
- Adjacency is checked against facts rather than a stored answer — 109 borders,
  Missouri and Tennessee eight neighbours each, Maine only New Hampshire, Alaska
  and Hawaii none, and the same answer anywhere between a 1 px and a 4 px
  tolerance.
- The projection used for uploaded geography is equal-area to within 0.0000%,
  tested on graticule cells of known equal area. That is not a preference: the
  cartogram scales every region so drawn area tracks seat count, which is only
  meaningful if the source areas tracked ground area.

## Where the code lives

| File | Role |

| `sh/01_prep_geo.sh` | mapshaper: project, simplify, dissolve |
| `R/lib_geom.R` | Sampling, balancing, power diagram, half-plane clipping |
| `R/lib_assign.R` | The Hungarian algorithm and its brute-force self-test |
| `R/lib_discs.R` | Boundary discs and the rigid-body separation |
| `web/solver.js` | The whole numerical half, ported: geometry, sampling, k-means, balancing, cells, adjacency, disc relaxation, Hungarian |
| `sh/12_test_solver.js` | Checks the port against the R build |
