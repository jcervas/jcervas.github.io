                Equal weight is given to each state in the Senate despite the vast discrepancy in population across the states. This point of view is shared by the founders, some of which found it necessary to have such institution to support the proposed Constitution, and is supported by political scientist research <cite id="LeeOppenheimer1999, Dahl2003">(see e.g., Lee and Oppenheimer 1999; Dahl 2003)</cite>. Journalists <cite id="Badger2016">(see e.g., Badger 2016)</cite> continue to argue that the U.S. Senate is inherently undemocratic. In addition to structural malapportionment introduced by the three-fifth's clause of the U.S. Constitutional in the antebellum period, there are some features of House apportionment that keep it from perfect proportionality.<footnote>Even the most proportional of allocation methods require rounding into integer values or, as is the case in the U.S. for apportioning the House, may have guaranteed seats for particular types of units regardless of their population. Such rules can create a discrepancy between apportioned seats and actual state population shares. While today's House districts are almost identical in population to one another within any given state, the combination of apportionment rounding rules (the so-called integer allocation problem <cite id="BalinskiYoung2001">Balinski and Young 2001</cite>,) and the rule that no state can be denied a seat in the House of Representatives regardless of its population, introduces malapportionment into the U.S. House when calculated nationally and not for each state separately.</footnote> However, in the post-<em>Baker v. Carr</em>, 369 U.S. 186 (1962) era, <cite id="LadewigJasinski2008, LadewigMcKee2014">(Ladewig and Jasinski 2008; Ladewig and McKee 2014)</cite> the House is nonetheless regarded as providing a level of representation matching population, and the same assessment is generally made for state legislative apportionment.<footnote>Malapportionment across states can also occur for the U.S. House of Representatives when Congress fails to fulfill its decennial duty to reapportion the House in accord with new population data. After the 1920 Census, Congress failed to reapportion the House. (see e.g. <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2015/03/01/congress-counts-history-of-the-us-census/">National Archives -- Pieces of History</a>).</footnote>Similarly, it is part of the common wisdom that the Electoral College (EC) is currently highly malapportioned because its two-seat bonus based on Senate seats over-weights small states (see e.g., <cite id="Moffett1895, Griffin2006, Toles2018">Moffett 1895; Griffin 2006; Toles 2018).</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this section, I examine these views empirically by comparing malapportionment in the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Electoral College over the period 1790-2010 by examining multiple metrics coming from law (e.g., the <em>total population deviation</em>), political science [e.g., the <em>Gallagher Index</em> <cite id="Gallagher1991">(Gallagher 1991)</cite>, and the <em>Loosemore-Hanby Index</em>, <cite id="Loosemore1971">(Loosemore and Hanby 1971)</cite>, and economics (e.g., the <em>Gini coefficient</em> <cite id="Lorenz1905">(Lorenz 1905)</cite></footnote>. In order to make our malapportionment measures across the three institutions comparable, I create units from states of equal size, depending on the total population of the state and the number of units in the state. This means that, when I examine the U.S. House of Representatives, I are not interested in questions of within-state variation in district population pre and post-<em>Baker v. Carr</em> or in the manipulation of district populations for partisan purposes <cite id="Grofman1990, Engstrom2013, McGann_et_al_2016_gerrymandering">(Grofman 1990; Engstrom 2013; McGann et al. 2016)</cite>. For Congress, inter-state malapportionment in the U.S. is effectively zero, since in <em>Vieth v. Jubelirer</em> 541 U.S. 267 (2004), the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Pennsylvania redistricting plan on the grounds that it didn't adhere to 'one person, one vote' with a deviation of 19 people. The court has been effectively silent on inter-state malapportionment, leaving a potential question open about whether any deviation across states is constitutional. In <em>U.S. Commerce v. Montana</em> 503 U.S. 442 (1992), Montana argued that the method of apportionment violated Article I ยง 2 because under the 1941 law that established the ``method of equal proportions'' Montana was to lose one of their two seats. Had it retained it's two seats, both seats would have been closer to the ideal (national) district population than the one district it had under the apportionment method used. In a 9-0 ruling, the court held that ``Congress exercised its apportionment authority within the limits dictated by the Constitution''. The Supreme Court summary disposed the district court's ruling in <em>Clemons v. U.S. Department of Commerce</em> 710 F. Supp. 2d 570 (N.D. Miss. 2010), which challenged directly inter-state malapportionment, on the grounds of lack jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most common metrics used by U.S. courts to measure malapportionment across individual districts looks at just two districts; the one most underrepresented and the one most over-represented. Seats-votes disproportionality measures used in the electoral systems literature are adapted to the malapportionment context to look at the full distribution of population values and electoral weights. The adaption of the measure of inequality from economics, the <em>Gini coefficient</em>, does the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                I show that apportionment equality in the Electoral College looks far more like apportionment equality for the U.S. House of Representatives than it looks like that in the U.S. Senate, regardless of which metric used. Indeed, when EC malapportionment is evaluated using the two metrics that are most common is the electoral systems literature to measure seats-votes disproportionality, this analysis leads to the conclusion that the EC behaves with respect to seats to population comparisons much like a proportional representation system does with respect to seats to votes comparisons, though with much smaller deviations. Similarly, a <em>Gini-index</em> based measure of EC malapportionment suggests very little bias, especially as compared to the vast discrepancies observed in income distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, I also show that for both the House and the EC, the time-series data on the magnitude of the malapportionment over the period 1790-2010 is very flat regardless of which measure used, with some measures of the EC even showing a very minor downtrend in recent elections. <footnote>This trend would show less disparity if we were to re-examine the antebellum period removing the provision that apportioned enslaved blacks as only three-fifths of that of all other persons, or adjusted our measures to include a correction based on who was excluded from the franchise.</footnote> In contrast, different metrics lead us to quite different perceptions of changes over time in malapportionment in the Senate. All measures, however, agree that the Senate is far more malapportioned than either the House or the EC <cite id="LadewigJasinski2008">Ladewig and Jasinski 2008</cite>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="background">Historical Background</h2>
            <p>
                In the U.S., while malapportionment bias is often regarded as inherently undesirable from a normative perspective, it was the perceived effects on government policies stemming from under-representation of city dwellers within states that motivated much of the sentiment that agitated pre-<em>Baker v. Carr</em> reformers (see e.g. <em>Baker v. Carr</em>, 369 U.S. 186, 1962, <em>Reynolds v. Sims</em>, 377 U.S. 533, 1964) <cite id="Baker1955, McCubbinsSchwartz1988">(Baker 1955; McCubbins and Schwartz 1988)</cite>. The failure to reapportion after the 1920 Census was brought about because of reluctance to transfer seats from more rural states whose population was falling, in relative terms, to heavily urban states with growing populations. And, today, while there remains concern for malapportionment in the Senate, the practical foci of current reformers are, on the one hand, on ways to control partisan gerrymandering within states and, on the other hand, the perceived partisan bias in the EC that is now operating in a pro-Republican direction that leads reformers to seek to replace the EC with a popular vote mechanism for choosing the President or to find other mechanisms that will limit divergence between popular vote and EC outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                But malapportionment, in and of itself, may or may not have direct pernicious consequences for the treatment of particular political parties or cognizable groups of voters with distinct interests. Singapore has high levels of parliamentary malapportionment, but that malapportionment does not appear to have effects that favor the ruling party, the PAP <cite id="Tan2018">(Tan and Grofman 2018)</cite>. In contrast, malapportionment in Japan has historically favored rural areas by over-representing rural voters, and thus been a boon to the the dominant party in Japan, the LDP, whose greatest strength derived from rural voters <cite id="Moriwaka2008">Moriwaka (2008)</cite>. <cite id="Stewart_Weingast1992">Stewart and Weingast (1992)</cite> show that in the $19<sup>th</sup> century ``Republicans had manufactured [an] advantage through the strategic admittance of sparsely populated, but strongly Republican, western states. These western ``pocket'' boroughs provided Republicans with a head start in the Electoral College, and an almost insurmountable lock on the Senate'' (as cited in <cite id="Engstrom2013">Engstrom 2013</cite> pg. 94). In the current political climate, the partisan implications of malapportioment are much less clear, with over-represented states being controlled by both the Democrats and the Republicans. For instance, the two-seat bonus awarded to all states, benefiting the small population states, has had virtually no effect on the Electoral College outcomes <cite id="CervasGrofman2019_SSQ">Cervas and Grofman 2019)</cite>. <footnote>As will be further examined in section three of this disseration.</footnote> Moreover, there are other types of effects that malapportionment might produce in addition to direct effects on party representation. <cite id="SamuelsSnyder2001">Samuels and Snyder (2001, pg. 653)</cite>, reviewing a number of single country studies, concludes ``malapportionment can have an important impact on executive-legislative relations, intra-legislative bargaining and the overall performance of democratic systems.''
            </p>
            <p>
                Addressing the partisan consequences of malapportionment is, however, outside the scope of this research note. Here the goal a straightforward and more limited task: assessing the levels of malapportionment in the House, Senate and Electoral College over time and under several different metrics. The linkage (or absence of linkage) between malapportionment and the success of Democratic and Republican candidates for the various offices is a worthwhile investigation. I share the view of <cite id="Dahl1971">Dahl (1971)</cite> that the ``one person, one vote'' principle is a necessary component of democratic governance. Moreover, as <cite id="Taagepera1989">Taagepera and Shugart (1989)</cite> have articulatly put it, malapportionment is ``a pathology''. Assess malapportionment requires a way to measure it. However, different approaches to measuring malapportionment can yield us very different conclusions about its level.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of the rest of this essay is straightforward. First I'll introduce the definitions of the seven measures that typify the universe of measures (total population deviation, ratio of largest to smallest district, proportion of population in units with enough seats to command a majority, the Gini Index, 80/20 percentile rank ratio, Loosemore-Hanby index, and Gallagher index). I provide graphs showing the empirical values of these seven indices over the period 1790-2010 for the U.S. House, the Senate, and the Electoral College, with some additional information about exactly how values in the various graphs were ascertained. I'll discuss the implications of our findings for both present-day malapportionment and the historical changes in malapportionment levels in the three national U.S. electorally determined institutions, including a discussion of whether malapportionment in these three institutions has moved in synchrony among them.
            </p>
            <h2 id="sec:measuring">Measuring Malapportionment</h2>
            <p>
                Regardless of whether or why malapportionment is regarded as problematic, logically prior is the question: ``How do we measure malapportionment?''. While there is a `zoo' of potential measures <cite id="TaageperaGrofman2003">(Taagepera and Grofman 2003)</cite>, I focus on a select few which are preeminent in the scholarly and legal literature. It is well recognized that no single measure of disproportionality can capture every feature of interest, and each measure has some desirable properties and some flaws <cite id="Cox1991, Monroe1994, Taagepera2013">(Cox and Shugart 1991; Monroe 1994; Taagepera, Selb, and Grofman 2014)</cite>. The theoretical virtues of the different measures have been extensively investigated <cite id="Monroe1994, TaageperaGrofman2003, Karpov2008, VanPuyenbroeck2008">(Monroe 1994; Taagepera and Grofman 2003; Karpov 2008; Van Puyenbroeck 2008)</cite>. I will not try seek to contribute to the literature on axiomatic comparisons of equality measures beyond some specific points regarding their relationship with malapportionment. Similarly I will not seek to discuss which of these measures are best. I'll simply conclude that different measures pick up different facets of inequality. Thus we disagree with <cite id=SamuelsSnyder2001>Samuels and Snyder (2001)</cite> who reject the use of <em>total population deviation</em> as completely inappropriate. I am not willing to dismiss a court chosen measure of malapportionment out of hand. Instead I will compare empirically the results from different measures.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus in this section will be empirical, looking at the historical measurement of U.S. political institutions (the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Electoral College) and what the different measures say about long-term trends and overall magnitudes of disproportionality in each over the period 1790-2010. The issue of malapportioned voting units can be traced at least as far back as the Roman Republic, where voting was by units based on income level, with the wealthy greatly over-represented <cite id="Manin1997">(Manin 1997)</cite>. The measures will compare the most common measure used in U.S. Courts, along with other measures proposed by political scientists pre-<em>Baker v. Carr</em>, with applications to the population context of those found more recently in the comparative politics literature measuring vote-seat disparities, and of the two common measures of inequality in the economics literature. The degree of concordance among some of our measures is, we believe, rather surprising, as are the results about which measures are most in disagreement with other measures, and how the degree of disagreement among measures varies across the three institutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For simplicity of exposition, I present below definitions of all four measures used by courts or proposed by early reformers for use by U.S. courts for the case of single seat constituencies. <footnote>There are many complexities in defining malapportionment when we move from simple single-seat systems to countries with multi-seat districts and/or a mix of single and multiple seat districts, and/or a tiered system with proportional allocations or compensatory seats in the upper tier <cite id="SamuelsSnyder2001">(Samuels and Snyder 2001)</cite>. Because the House and Senate are single seats constituencies, such complications arise only vis-a-vis the Electoral College. There, we weight states by their EC seat share.</footnote> Let $p_i =persons $ in the $i_{th}$ constituency, $P =total \mspace{3mu} population =\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i}$, $ \hat{p} =ideal \mspace{3mu} population $, i.e., the total population divided by the total number of seats $n$. Constituencies are indexed by $ i =1,...,n $. $ p_{max} $ is the district in the constituency with the largest population, $ p_{min} $ is the district in the constituency with the smallest population. Issues of whether to use measures based on something other than census-based population counts, such as total citizen population or eligible voters speak to issues quite distinct from those considered in this paper. <footnote>See <em>Evenwel v. Abbott</em> 578 U.S. ___ (2015).</footnote> Because the central concern that motivated this paper was malapportionment in the Electoral College, as noted earlier, all our calculations use states as the units. This means that the measure of congressional malapportionment only captures inter-state differences in mean population per House districts. This is equivalent to taking constituency populations within a state to be identical.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sec:legal">Legal Measures of Malapportionment and early Political Science Approaches</h3>
            <p>
                The aftermath of <em>Baker v. Carr</em> (1962) initially led U.S. federal courts to consider a number of different ways to measure malapportionment <cite id="NCSL2019">(NCSL 2019)</cite>. It also took a while for there to be definitive legal standards for what levels of malapportionment would be acceptable at different levels of government <cite id="NCSL2019">(NCSL 2019)</cite>. But, rather quickly, the U.S. Supreme Court focused on a particular measure, the <em>total population deviation</em> (<em>TPD</em>, Equation <a href="#eq:tpd">1</a>, also referred to as <em>Relative Deviation</em> or <em>total maximum deviation</em>), which looks at the relative difference in population between the most underpopulated and the most overpopulated district to the ideal district size. Among other measures initially proposed by political scientists <cite id="Baker1966">(see esp. Baker 1966)</cite> are the <em>Max/Min</em> (Equation <a href="eq:maxmin">2</a>, sometimes called <em>population deviation ratio</em>, <em>population variance ratio</em>, <em>overall range</em>, <em>voter equivalency ratio</em>, or <em>maximum deviation</em>), which is the ratio of the population in the largest district to that in the smallest;<footnote>Note that the <em>total population deviation</em> measures the absolute difference between seats and votes while the <em>population deviation ratio</em> is based on a ratio.</footnote> the <em>minimum population share</em>, which identifies the minimum population needed to control a majority of seats in the legislature; and the <em>average absolute level of deviation</em> (Equation <a href="eq:avgdev">3</a>). The last of these measures is mathematically equivalent to <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> (Equation <a href="eq:loose">4</a>) of malapportionment; I reserve discussion of it until the discussion of political science approaches to malapportionment, where it will be referred to it under the latter title.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>TPD</em> measure is conceptually very simple, and like the other three measures it can be used to specify a <em>de minimis</em> threshold that can serve as a ``bright-line'' test for courts. Though often called the ``total'' population deviation (or variance), it might better be called the ``maximum'' population deviation since it only describes the relationship between the two most extreme units and nothing about the nature of malapportionment in the other constituencies. Virtually every other democracy which imposes some form of ``one person, one vote'' test on its parliamentary constituencies has also adopted a <em>TPD</em> based measure, though with widely differing thresholds, most far higher than the ones adopted in the U.S. (e.g., 30% in Germany and 50% in Canada). See <cite id="HandleyGrofman2008">Handley and Grofman (2008)</cite> for a review of legal malapportionment thresholds in many countries. Readers must be careful in interpreting reported thresholds. In the U.S., courts have leveled different standards for different legislatures. For example, the threshold in Germany is stated as no more than 15% upwards or downwards from the average, and those who write about Germany may thus correctly characterize it as a 15% tolerance limit but, in our terms, this is a 30% <em>TPD</em> value.
            </p>
            <p id="#eq:TPD">
                (1) <em>Total population deviation</em> (TPD) =

                \end{equation}
                The TPD is sometimes written as
                \begin{equation*}

                Finally, to find the <em>minimum population share</em> needed to control a majority of the seats in the legislature, for the case of single seat constituencies, order the districts from smallest to largest by population per district. Find the population of the units up to and including the pivotal unit $(m)$ and then divide by the total population to obtain the proportion. To calculate it for the Electoral College, take the population of each unit in the EC to be equal to each state's population divided by its number of EC seats. <footnote>This metric has also been labeled as the ``electoral percentage'' <cite id="Dixon1968">(Dixon 1968)</cite> and the <em>theoretical control index</em> <cite id="GrofmanScarrow1981">(Grofman and Scarrow 1981)</cite>. Sometimes the resulting vote proportion is divided by two in order to indicate that only a majority of the votes in each constituency are needed to control the outcome in that constituency, i.e., a party that wins only the barest of majorities in a bare majority of seats in two-party competition can win the election. We will not make use of this normalizing divisor.</footnote>

                In contrast to the measures used in courts, when students of politics study redistricting, they utilize instead measures of malapportionment adapted from the electoral systems literature on measuring the discrepancy between party vote share and party seat share <cite id="SamuelsSnyder2001, SaugerGrofman2016">(Samuels and Snyder2001, Sauger and Grofman 2016)</cite>.

            <p>
                The economists use of measures of inequality is most commonly found in the study of income inequality <cite id="Yntema1933, Atkinson1970, Foster1985, BaiLagunoff2013">(Yntema 1933; Atkinson 1970; Foster 1985; Bai and Lagunoff 2013)</cite>. A standard approach in the economic literature on inequality is to report <em>fractiles</em> or <em>percentile ratios</em>, e.g., the proportion of income held by, say, the richest 80% of the population divided by the proportion of income held by the poorest 20% of the population <cite id="Pareto1896">(Pareto 1896)</cite>. Similarly, the the ratio of seat shares to population shares at the $20^{th}$ and $80^{th}$ percentiles can help us understand malapportionment. <footnote>The ratio approach in terms of percentile ranks like the ratio approach in terms of largest and smallest district population throws away some of the information about the shape of the distribution <em>in toto</em>. The percentile method is equlivaant to the Max/Min approach, but instead of using the values at the 100% and the lowest percentile, it takes values that concievably eliminate any outliers.</footnote> I have chosen to measure the $80^{th}$ and $20^{th}$ percentiles for the tables and figures presented in the empirical section of the paper, but the $\frac{80}{20}$ ratio is only intended to be illustrative. It is but one of many ratios I might have used.
            </p>
            <p>
                The percentile method provides just a crude understanding of malapportionment. The <em>Lorenz curve</em>, a graphical tool for displaying inequality first proposed in 1905 by <cite id="Lorenz1905">Max Otto Lorenz (1905)</cite> is the natural way to summarize the entire distribution. On a two-dimensional scatterplot, plot the cumulative percentages of the population, on one axis and the cumulative share of income arranged from lowest to highest on the other. This is the <em>Lorenz curve</em>. Where all points on the plot are identical, $x=y$, a straight line is drawn, often called the <em>line of equality</em>. That is, the top $k\%$ of the population holds $k\%$ of the income. To provide a single measure derived from a Lorenz curve the <em>Gini coefficient</em> is used. It is defined as the ratio of the area of the cumulative frequency distribution and the area below the <em>line of equality</em>. This area allows for meaningful comparisons among Lorenz curves which intersect. It can be found through interpolation with actual data or can be calculated analytically for different assumed distributional shapes. Similarly, for a legislature or for the Electoral College, plot cumulative population share versus cumulative seat share. In the context of economic inequality, the <em>Gini coefficient</em> been called the single best measure of inequality <cite id="Morgan1962">(Morgan 1962)</cite>, but, as noted earlier, I will not attempt to judge measures normatively but rather to assess their degree of concordance when applied to important real world applications. Another approach to equality found in the economic literature is based on voting power using a game theory measure of power such as the <em>Shapley-Shubik</em> index <cite id="Shapley1954">(Shapley and Shubik 1954)</cite> or the <em>Banzhaf index</em> <cite id="Banzhaf1965">(Banzhaf 1965)</cite>. I will not consider this approach to inequality here.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a <em>Lorenz curve</em>, order districts such that $v_1 \leq v_2 \leq v_n$ where each district $i=1,...,n$ gets allocated its share of $V$, the total vote-share. Individual shares are $v_i =\frac{p_i}{V}$ and $1 =\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_i$. The cumulative proportion of $V$ is then plotted on the x-axis and the cumulative population share on the y-axis. The points start with $(0,0)$ and end at $(1,1)$.

            <h2 id="sec:empirical">Empirical Comparisons of Six Measures of Malapportionment</h2>
            <p>
                Natural questions to ask are: ``How much and in what ways does the choice of malapportionment measure chosen affect the conclusions we reach about level of malapportionment?'', ``How have malapportionment levels in the three institutions (the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. Electoral College) we study changed over time?'' and, ``Are there measures that, while appearing distinct mathematically, tend to give similar answers?''.
            </p>
            <p>
                I address these questions with U.S. Census data over the period 1790 to 2010. Different apportionment methods, i.e., different ways in which fractional shares of the population are rounded to create whole numbers, will lead to slightly different levels of malapportionment <cite id="Huckabee2001,GainesJenkins2009">(Huckabee 2001; Gaines and Jenkins 2009)</cite>. The U.S. has used five different methods of apportionment in it's history <cite id="Young2004">(Young 2004)</cite>. The differences do not affect the substantive intepretation of malapportionment for the purposes described in this essay. We apply the "Hill-Huntington" method, which has been used in the U.S. since the 1940 census (2 U.S.C. 2a), to the entire time-series and for both the U.S. House and the Electoral College. For 1790-1990, the source is the U.S Census Bureau Population Division working paper NO. 56 <footnote>Historical Census Statistics On Population Totals By Race, 1790 To 1990, And By Hispanic Origin, 1970 To 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, And States <cite id="Census2002_PopulationDivision">(Gibson and Jung 2002)</cite>.</footnote>, for 2000 it is table P003 from the 2000 decennial census, and for 2010 it is from table P3 of the 2010 decennial census. Apportionment for the U.S. House and Electoral College was tabulated in <code>R</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We make several simplifying assumptions in order to compare across time.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, the District of Columbia is not included in either the U.S. House or Senate calculations, and its population is likewise subtracted from the national population figures we use. For the purposes of this essay, I do not include the populations of U.S. territories (e.g, Puerto Rico). Although they are U.S. citizens, they currently do not have any voting representation in U.S. political institutions. Amendment XXIII, ratified in the 1960s, gives D.C. received three electoral votes (regardless of its population). <footnote>D. C. may receive additional EC votes in the future if it's population is sufficiently large to warrant it, and no other state has fewer EC seats than it does.</footnote>. D.C. is included in the Electoral College measures for all periods beginning in 1960. D.C. population is added to the national population total for the EC only. <footnote>Legislation has passed the U.S. House for the first time ever on June 26, 2020 (H.R. 51 -- 116<sup>th</sup> Congress) which would, if approved by the U.S. Senate and signed by the president, make D. C. the 51<sup>st</sup> state. If D. C. were to become a state, it would be entitled to two U.S. Senators as well as its share of the apportioned 435 members of Congress.</footnote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, even though different apportionment methods have been used in different census decades, I calculate apportionment using the Hill-Huntington method (<em>Method of Equal Proportions</em>), used for apportioning the U.S. House of Representatives and Electoral College since 1941 so as to have consistency over time. <footnote>After no apportionment in 1920 after a stalemate in Congress, reapportionment was resumed in 1930 and a rule was set in place that provided for automatic reapportionment after in each census in accord with a specified apportionment formula. While that formula was changed for the 1940 census, and <a href="https://www.census.gov/population/apportionment/about/history.html">a still different formula had been used early in the nation's history</a>, the differences in allocation across apportionment formulae tend to be minor <cite id="Janson2012; BalinskiYoung2001">(see Balinski and Young 2001, cf. Janson and Linusson 2012)</cite>.</footnote> Though no apportionment was actually done in 1920, we provide the hypothetical 1920 apportionment from the Census population using the Hill-Huntington method.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, even though the basis of apportionment has changed over time with respect to the inclusion/weighting of African-Americans and Native Americans,<footnote>Article I, ยง 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution says ``Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.'' Amendment XIV repealed this provision, requiring ``representative shall be apportioned... counting the whole number of persons in each State...''</footnote> I calculate <u>apportioment</u> from the summation of the total free population plus three-fifths of the slave population</footnote> for the U.S. House and Electoral College throughout the entire time period. <footnote>From 1870 on, this is equivolant to using the total population as the basis for apportionment.</footnote> For all years I use the total population where every person is counted as one whole person, as the populaiton basis for measuring representation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I am most interested in comparisons at the state level in order to facilitate direct comparisons between the House, the Senate, and the Electoral College. Despite severe intra-state malapportionment in the U.S. House prior to <em>Baker v. Carr</em>, <footnote>See e.g., <cite id="Altman1998_SSH, LadewigJasinski2008, Engstrom2013">Altman (1998); Ladewig and Jasinski (2008); Engstrom (2013)</cite></footnote>, as noted earlier, for the House I treat each district within a state as the state's population divided by the number of members in that state; i.e., $ideal \: population = average \: population$.<footnote>With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states currently award the state's total Electoral College votes based on the state-wide plurality winner. I use this state unit-rule for all states over the entire period.</footnote> For all three of the institutions under study, I calculate the ideal population per seat as the total U.S. population divided by the total number of seats. <footnote>Two for each state for the U.S. Senate, and for recent decades, 435 for the U.S. House and 538 for the EC. In effect, as noted earlier, we treat the House districts in each state as having an identical population, namely the population of the state divided by the number of House seats allocated to that state.</footnote> Table <a href="tab:dist_details">1</a> shows the minimum district, the maximum district, and the ideal district size for each of the three institutions.

                All seven of the metrics in Figure <a href="#fig:1">1</a> support the claim that EC malapportionment is far closer to low levels of House malapportionment than it is to the high levels of U.S. Senate malapportionment. For the <em>total population deviation</em>, as a matter of mathematical necessity, as long as the most over-represented and most under-represented state in the EC is the same as their counterpart in the U.S. House, malapportionment in the EC must be larger than malapportionment in the U.S. House. Indeed, if we compare the most recent values we get for those measures to their equivalents in the seats-votes disproportionality context, both the U.S. House and even the U.S. Electoral College exhibit low levels of disproportionality. The levels shown in Figures 1 d \& e, while not as small as the party-based disproportionalities reported for the most highly proportional electoral rules in use world-wide, those of Netherlands <footnote>2017 Dutch Election: <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> - 1.3, <em>Gallagher</em> - 6. Data source: https://www.kiesraad.nl/</footnote>, and Israel <footnote>2015 Knesset Election: Loosemore-Hanby - 1.5, Gallagher - 7. Data source: https://www.knesset.gov.il</footnote> are comparable to the partisan disproportionalities in other western European democracies. For example, tabulating data from <cite id="Doring2017"> D&ouml;ring and Manow (2017, Table 3: pg. 159)</cite> shows that proportional countries have an average <em>Gallagher</em> value of 3.89 and majoritarian countries average 12.12. The U.S. House in 2010 was 0.157, the EC was 0.589, and the Senate 7.78.
            </p>
            <p>
                All seven measures also show a relatively flat pattern of malapportionment for the House and the EC, in general and especially over the past several decades. While, as noted above, the U.S. Senate is far and away the most disproportionate of the three institutions under all measures, unlike what we find for the House and the EC, there are substantial differences across the measures in the over time pattern of Senate malapportionment. For example, the <em>Total Population Deviation</em> metric shows the Senate rather steadily exhibiting ever higher levels of malapportionment, though recently leveling off; the <em>Gini coefficient</em> and the <em>Loosemore-Hanby index</em> show a similar upward pattern, but not as steep, as does the <em>minimum population share</em>. <footnote>The y-axis is flipped on Figure 1 (C) to match the other figures such that when inequality increases, the line plot goes up.</footnote> While voting majorities are not typically determined by state size, this finding rises the prospects of significantly less than 50% of the population controlling the majority of votes in the U.S. Senate. But the <em>Max/Min ratio</em>, in contrast, tends to ebb and flow over time, albeit with the present values still considerably higher than those in the United States' earliest history; the same is true for the Percentile (80/20) ratio, though levels in 2010 are closer to the high levels of the late $19^{th}$ century than the levels at the founding. Finally, the <em>Gallagher index</em> shows first a gradual fall and then a more gradual rise.

            <p>
                Since the first two of the measures, <em>TPD</em> and <em>Max/Min</em>, focus on the same two constituencies (the largest and smallest), there is an expectation that these two disproportionality measures should correlate highly with one another. <footnote>Though they are the same with-in each institution, it is not necessarily the case the more or least represented constituencies be the same in the House or Senate or EC.</footnote> They are quite highly correlated for both the U.S. House and the Electoral College, with a correlation exceeding</footnote> $r=0.90$ for each institution. But, the same is not true for the U.S. Senate, as the correlation between these two measures is much lower, though still positive at $r=0.51$. The reduced correlation in the Senate between the two measures is due in part to the admission of extremely small states into the union in the mid nineteenth century <cite id="Stewart_Weingast1992, Engstrom2013">(Stewart and Weingast 1992; Engstrom 2013)</cite>, since the ratio measure is even more strongly dependent on extreme values than the difference measure. <footnote>For instance, Nevada entered the union in 1864 with a census population in 1860 of 6,857 (we use 1870's population of 42,491 for the calculations.)</footnote>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Minimum winning population</em> is strongly correlated with the <em>Gini coefficient</em> for all three institutions, as is <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em>. Similarly, <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> and the <em>Minimum winning population</em> are also highly correlated with each other. Thus, whatever the differences in the axiomatic properties of these three metrics, in practice, at least for the historical data on the three U.S. institutions we examine, they tend to move in parallel. In factor analytic terms, these three measures scale on the same dimension.
                <!-- There is a similar pattern of correlation for the percentile (80/20) ratio but, despite the high linear correlations, examining Figure <a href="#fig:1">1</a> it is clear that, for the Senate, it yields a non-monotonic pattern and thus caution of the results of linear correlation analysis is urged. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast, <em>Gallagher</em> and <em>Max-Min ratio</em> exhibit divergent patterns with the other measures for some of our three institutions. <em>Max/Min</em> and <em>Percentile</em> are positively correlated to simlar degrees across the three institutions, and <em>Max/Min</em> and <em>Gallagher</em> are negatively correlated for all three, <em>Max/Min</em> and the rest of the measures have correlations that are sometimes positive and sometimes negative. The inconsistency of the <em>Max/Min</em> measures raises some serious concerns about its reliability for measuring malapportionment. As the reader will recall, this is the measure the courts regularly turn to when striking down districting plans for failing to meet the 'one person, one vote' standard.
            </p>
            <p>
                We might have expected <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> and <em>Gallagher</em> to be highly correlated since they are are very similar in mathematical form, but empirically their correlation varies by institution. For the U.S. House, they are highly correlated ($r=0.95$); for the EC, they are likewise positively correlated ($r=0.12$); for the U.S. Senate, they are negatively correlated ($r=-0.43$). More generally, The <em>Gallagher</em> measure is negatively correlated with most other measures. <footnote>With the exceptions of minimum winning population for the Senate, which has a correlation of $r=0.57$, Percentile in the House ($r=0.27$), and the Gini Coefficient for the House and EC ($r=0.95, r=0.26$).</footnote> This difference in strength of correlation across institutions reflects the discounting by <em>Gallagher</em> of the contribution to malapportionment of very small jurisdictions, a factor which plays a more important role in shaping values in the Senate and the EC than it does in the House.
            </p>
            <h3 id="#sec:paradox">The Paradox of Malapportionment</h3>
            <p>
                Although I have made a point to limit the analysis to the measurement of malapportionment, more should be said about the axiomatic properties that might make them more or less useful at capturing the spirit and theoretical properties that are useful for evaluating an institution. To this end, in the period 1790 to 1870, the non-free population in the U.S. was counted for the purposes of apportionment as three-fifths of a free person. If all people were apportioned with the same weight, objectively the insitution would be more equal, and thus have less malapportionment. I compare for the U.S. House (and Electoral College) the differences between apportioning the antebellum period (1790-1870) as it happened, and a counterfactual where each person, free or slave, received the whole weight of representation. By definition, when everyone is counted equivalently, malapportionment is reduced. In this example, the counterfactual, where slaves are counted as whole people, should result in lower levels of malapportionment across all measures. The magnitude of the difference will help to illustrate which measures are most robust. Since the three-fifths clause only had an effect on apportionment prior to 1870, we limit this section of the analysis to those years, 1790-1860.
            </p>
            <p>
                The U.S. slave population by 1860 was 3.9 million, representing about 12.6% of the total U.S. population. 57.2% of South Carolina's 1860 census population was slave, which, when discounted by a factor of two-fifths for apportionment, South Carolina suffered a loss of 241,000 voters. Thus, South Carolina, like many other southern states, received only approximately 65% of their U.S. House seats and Electoral College votes. But while northern, non-slave states clearly benefit from this arrangement, it was indeed southerns who ultimately compromised on three-fifths, since this greatly increases their representation in the federal government compared to the north's proposed apportionment which would have not counted slaves at all. Over fourteen percent of all Americas were counted as slaves during the eighty year antebellum period. Clearly, the compromise made at the founding of the nation affected representation through systematic malapportionment directed at heavily African-American states. Recalling the measures used in the above sections, I look at the differences between the U.S. House as apportioned with all residents counted in the way we have since 1870, and compare that to how it was counted before 1870. This difference-in-difference design gives us leverage to see which of the measures are responsive to a clear difference in malapportionment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Readers are urged to keep in mind that, in the way in which malapportionment is calculated, while the districts allocated to each state might change, the total population is the same for both sets. That means that if State A is apportioned 2 members from a population of 10,000 under one rule, but only 1 member from the same 10,000 population under a second rule, and the total members is unchanged, they will have recieved more representation under rule one. In the equivalent setup for seats-votes in the comparative politics literature, it is the translation of votes for a party into their seats-share. So, what percentage of seats for each party is associated with a what percentage of the votes. For instance, keeping with the earlier example of South Carolina (SC) in 1860, you'll recall that the total population was 703,708 of which 402,406 were slaves. Under the apportionment in place where slaves were counted as three-fifth, SC received four congressional districts (six EC Electors). Using the Hill-Huntington apportionment formula, had the constitution counted slaves in the same manner they did a free person, they would have been entitled to five congressional districts (seven EC Electors). In effect, each member of congress should have represented 140,742 people, but instead, they represented 175,927. Likewise, since the total members of congress was determined before apportionment, a state with no slaves would benefit in the reverse way. New Jersey, with it's population of 697,346, all of which counted as whole people, was only entitled to five congressional districts (averaging 139,469 constituents), but instead received six (at 116,224 persons per district).

                Unlike the analyses in the prior sections of this paper, here there is an intuition about expected levels of malapportionment. Given that there is a `control' measure, i.e., malapportionment that exist given the constitutional rule, and a `treatment', malapportionment levels when appoprtioment is done in a more equitable way, I can test whether the values are different. Since the expectation is that appointment based on the whole population will <em>always</em> have lower malapportionment, we set up the hypothesis such that:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Hypothesis 1a: The level of malapportionment will always be lower in the counterfactual example, compared to malapportionment when slaves are apportioned as only three-fifths a person.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Our corollary hypothesis is:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Hypothesis 2b: Regardless of the metric, there is the same proportion reduction in malapportionment corresponding to the known reduction in malapportionment.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing to notice in Table <a href="#tab:threefifths">3</a> that the <em>range</em> between the maximum and the minimum district is not uniformly lower for the more equal apportionment. That is, in 1840, the largest and small deviations for both apportionments is identical. The reason for this is that those districts, the minimum and maximum deviations, happen to both come from states in which there are no slaves, and happen to coincide for both apportionments. In all other years, the difference between the max and min deviations for the whole apportionment is smaller. This leads me to conclude that measures of malappointment that focus on just two districts are not robust to a reduction of malapportionment, creating a <em>paradox of malapportionment</em>. Mathematically, it is possible that the Max/Min measure, the TPD measure, and (less plausivly) the Percentile (80/20) measure could lead to a sitution where an institution that has less overall inequality shows non-the-less more malapportionment. In the same way that a <em>paradox of apportionment</em> <cite id="Young2004,BalinskiYoung2001">(Balinski and Young 2001; Young 2004)</cite> happens when seats are added but the population remains the same and a state loses representation, a paradox of malapportionment is when an electoral system is more equitable but the measure of disproportionately increases. This observations leads to the necessary conclusion that measures of malapportionment that rely on just the largest and smallest district are incompatible with the goal of understanding malapportionment. We further contend that these measures should <em>only</em> be used to answer questions about the range of malapportionment, or the worst cases. <footnote>Court use of TPD and Max/Min for purposes of evidence of any malapportionment makes sense since, if malapportionment exist between the any two districts, than it follows that checking the most extreme can inform the court in a bright-line way.</footnote>

                The paradox of malapportionment is not something that is to be expected for any of the other measures used in this essay. <em>Minimum population needed to control a majority</em> has the virtue of being a direct, additive measure of malapportionment. Districts are ordered such that those with the highest deviations (in the negative direction) are added district with the next least largest deviation until the population of those districts reaches 50%. In this way, the measure ignores a large portion of the districts. The same procedure happens for the <em>Gini index</em>. <em>Gallagher</em> and <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> indices operate in a different way, but both are immune to the paradox. For <em>Gallagher</em>, deviations are squared and for <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em>, deviations' absolute values are averaged. In both cases, when overall malapportionment is reduced, the devations are likewise reduces, leading the measurements to report lower levels of disproportionalities. <a href="#tab:threefifthsmal">Table 4</a> shows the measures of malapportionment for each of the eight years during the antebellum period for both apportionments. I also report the percent difference between the two.

                    <a href="#tab:threefifthsmal">Table 4</a> shows that Hypothesis 1a is not true. In both 1790 and 1840, the <em>TPD</em> measure does not uniformally show less malapportionment when all people are counted for apportionment (W). Additionally, as stated earlier, 1840 shows that the <em>Max/Min</em> measure is subject to the paradox of malapportionment. All of the other measures show uniformly less malapportionment in the counterfactual dataset where apportionment is calculated in a more equal way. The positive change in the <em>Minimum Winning Population</em> measure simply reflects the fact that it takes a greater proportion of the population to elect a majority in the U.S. House, as expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for Hypothesis 1b, we dismiss the measures outright of <em>TPD</em> and <em>Max/Min</em> as giving irrelevant information in regards to the reduced amount of inequality. It becomes tricky to judge if a measure is showing a robust adjustment to the changing inequality in an institution. Simply looking at the average change between the two apportionements gives a potentially bias perception since the way it measures in the first place may not be an accurate reflection of the inequalities. I therefore measure the change relative to a perfectly equal institution, i.e., one where 'one person, one vote' holds true. For <em>Max/Min</em>, that would mean a ratio of 1:1. For the <em>Gini index</em>, that would mean a coefficent of 1. For <em>Minimimum winning population</em>, equality would mean 50% of the population holds 50% of the voting power. So, to look at the change relative the base line, I take the value of the malapportionment measure and find its deviation from ideal, and do the same for the corresponding measure for the counterfactual. I then look at the difference between the two apportionment's measures relative to their baseline. I'll then average over the eight elections.

                    As Table 5 indicates, four of the measures of malapportionment show between 50% and 67% reduction in average malapportionment over the eight antebellum elections. Two of the measures show around 20% reduction on average, while the <em>Percentile</em> measure shows bacially no change between the two apportionments. During the time period 1790-1870, slaves represented around 14.5% of the total population. The representation of these individuals were discounted by two-fifths, which corresponds to states where these slaves reside receiving 5.8% less apportionment. Even without full representation, the U.S. House has a high level of equality in the translation of people to seats in the institution. This section has shown that giving non-free people full representation further reduces inequality by as much as 67%.

                    The goals of this essay have (1) been to address the magnitude of bias derived from the purely mechanical effects of rules determining the relationship between seat share and state population share in historical perspective for three important U.S. institutions, and (2) to assess the degree to which measures of inequality/disproportionality common in the disciplines of law, political science, and economics, when adapted to the malapportionment context, yield different answers to determining malapportionment inequality over time for the three institutions, and (3) to assess the robustness of the measures to known changes in inequality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The principal finding is a clear one: in practice, Electoral College malapportionment is not very much larger than malapportionment in the U.S. House of Representatives and EC malapportionment is far <u>lower</u> than the malapportionment we find in the U.S. Senate. The Electoral College may be regarded as essentially a mixture between an upper and a lower chamber, but far more closely resembling the latter. <cite id="SamuelsSnyder2001">Samuels and Snyder (2001)</cite> offer analysis of malapportionment in a comparative perspective which shows that malapportionment levels in upper chambers are characteristically much greater than in lower chambers. <!-- Indeed, as noted earlier in the text, the numbers for EC for the <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> and <em>Gallagher</em> indices shown in Figure 1 d \& e, while not as small as the party-based disproportionalities between votes and seats reported for the most highly proportional electoral rules in use world-wide, are comparable to the partisan votes-seats disproportionalities in other western European democracies. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, the analyses presented above demonstrate that despite the freezing of the House size and the logical presumption that malapportionment in the EC should therefore increase, the discrepancy between popular vote outcome and EC outcome that occurred in 2016 cannot be blamed on an increasing EC malapportionment in recent decades. <footnote>It can be shown that increasing the U.S. House by a reasonably small number would have led to a Gore victory <cite id="NeubauerZeitlin2003,Barthelemy2014">(Neubauer and Zeitlin 2003; Barthelemy, Martin, and Piggins 2014</cite>.</footnote> Contemporary levels of EC malapportionment are, by virtually all measures, presently at or slightly below historical levels.

                    The second major set of findings has to do with the degree of agreement among various malapportionment measures. The graphs presented in <a href="">Figure 1</a> help to show whether malapportionment has increase, decreased, or stayed flat since the country's founding under our various measures. <a href="">Table 2</a> lookes at the linear correlations among the seven measures. <a href="#fig:change">Figure 2</a> presents the same data as in <a href="">Figure 1</a> but in a way that facilitates comparisons across our different metrics. <a href="#fig:change">Figure 2</a> reveals that: (a) Comparing 2010 and 1790, for the U.S. House, all of the measures show decreasing amounts of malapportionment (with the partial exception of <em>Percentile</em> and <em>Minimum Population</em>, which are stagnant over time). (b) The seven measures of malapportionment in the Electoral College show a simiar decreasing pattern over time, though now it takes a slightly lower percentage of people to reach a majority in the EC. The <em>Gallagher</em> measures shows significant decrease in malapportioment since the founding, in constrast to the more limited changes found in the other measures. (c) In contrast, for the U.S. Senate, six of the seven measures show higher levels of malapportionment in 2010 than in 1790, while <em>Gallagher</em> shows a downwardly sloping pattern. Furthermore, (d) unlike the monotonicity, whether positive or negative, found for the Senate in the other five measures, <em>Max-Min ratio</em> and the closely related <em>Percentile ratio</em> exhibits non-monotonic patterns for the Senate over the period 1790-2010. (e) Five of the seven measures, all but <em>Gallagher</em> and <em>Max/Min</em>, correlate very strongly with one another and can, in factor analytic terms, be considered as scaling on a single dimension for all three institutions. (f) However, with respect to comparability across measures, the results about the <em>Gallagher index</em> are equally important. While, in the context of seats-votes disproportionalities, <em>Gallagher</em> is a metric that has recently been given a great deal of favorable attention, its lack of strong correlations with other measures, with negative correlations for two of our three institutions, suggests a sharp note of caution vis-a-vis its use in the context of malapportionment. <footnote> <cite id="Gallagher1991">Gallagher (1991)</cite> provides comparisons of the <em>Gallagher index</em> (which he refers to as the <em>least squares index</em>) with other measures in the context of national level seats-votes relationships. In that context he finds considerable similarity in results across measures.</footnote>

                <h2 id="sec:conc">Conclusions</h2>
                <p>
                    The axiomatic properties of these different measures offer little guidance as to which measure should be used for measuring malapportionment. I deflect on which is the best of these measures to use for understanding malapportionment in a political institution, and instead suggest that it depend on the question being asked. Small changes in population or apportionment method can lead to rather drastic deviations in individual districts. Apportionment methods themselves create a range of which the maximum and minimum district must be constrained. Since the U.S. Senate is not bound by apportionment, metrics that rely on the extreme deviations are free to increase without limit. Consider again the U.S. Senate; while most measures show between 20 and 60 percent increases in malapportionment since the founding, the Max/Min ratio shows a 500% increase. While it is true that the most over-represented state is significantly far from the ideal or average size state, the magnitude of <em>most</em> state's deviations are not nearly as large. I view this measure (along with <em>TPD</em>) as being a straw-man for those who would argue that the U.S. system of representation is broken. That is not to suggest that the present author does not view the levels of malapportionment in the U.S. Senate to be un-problematic.I simply observe that the three measures of malapportionment that rely on just two district deviations are the three measures that show the most increase since the founding. The four measures that incorporate information about the deviations of all districts give estimates of malapportionment that are smaller in magnitude. The <em>Gallagher</em> index indicates that malapportionment has decreased by 20% in the U.S. Senate since the founding, whereas every other measure of malapportionment indicates <em>at least</em> a 20% <u>increase</u>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the line-graphs jump around haphazardly, those interested in showing that the U.S. House has become significantly more equitable might point to the <em>Gallagher</em> index. It is surprising that most discussions of the <em>one person, one vote</em> revolution leave out the continuing discrepancies in district size across states in the U.S. House. <footnote>However, see <cite id="Ladewig2011">Ladewig (2011)</cite>, who shows that interstate malapportionment can exceed 9,000% that of intra-state malapportionment found unconstitutional.</footnote> Meanwhile, none of the measures point to any severe malapportionment of the House; even given the standard of strict proportionality expected of the U.S. House, none of the measures level a concern that some might find alarming. 
</p>
<p>
                    But the House is not without malapportionment concerns. Consider the known inequality that arises when (particularly a small) state is suddenly apportioned one fewer seat and goes from having a relatively low deviation from the national ideal to suddenly having one of the largest deviations. Residents of Montana have argued (<em>U.S. Commerce v. Montana</em> 503 U.S. 442 (1992)) that the apportionment formula of "Hill-Huntington" creates a deviation that is worse than if under different apportionment methods; a ratio of person's per representative of 799,065:1 (a deviation of 228,713 from ideal); but if they had two representatives, the ratio decreases to 399,533:1 (a deviation of 170,819). <footnote>It's not clear where that district would come from, because increasing the size of the House by one would have given Washington its ninth district, which would have reduced its deviation from ideal.</footnote> Certainly, residents of Montana suffer from poor representation in both the U.S. House (though they are benefited by the two-seat bonus in the Electoral College, they still end up with less influence than they might have). Congress having taken action to freeze the size of the U.S. House in the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act may have resulted in increased deviations. There is no such trend in the data, at least up until 2010. It's worth noting, however, that increasing the size of the House would reduce disproportionalities overall in both the U.S. House and the Electoral College. Indeed, after the 1830 apportionment, the size of the House decreased by 7%; though its affect on our measures was mixed, appearing <em>more</em> proportional in four of the seven measures. Likewise, adding D. C. as the 51<sup>st</sup> state, and Puerto Rico as the 52<sup>nd</sup> would change the levels of malapportionment in the U.S. Senate. But, because the population of D. C. is not large, it would be over-representated compared to the ideal, while Puerto Rico would be under-representated.

                    The results of this essay fly in the face of the common wisdom about how badly malapportioned the EC supposedly is. The explanation for the mismatch between expectations and reality is that the states with greatest seats to population advantage in the EC do not make up a large share of the EC vote. While malapportionment effects in the EC, like those for the House, seem minor, the results about population equality for the Senate, however, are quite different. The U.S. Senate presents a more serious challenge to our understanding of the majoritarian principle of democracy. When discussing 'one person, one vote'; When a noted democratic theorist <cite id="Dahl2003">Dahl (2003)</cite> asks, ``How Democratic Is the American Constitution?'' at least with respect to malapportionment, it is the Senate rather than the Electoral College for which this question is most relevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But that is not to say that continued use of the Electoral College does not pose issues of political fairness. The basic reason why EC malapportionment effects are commonly overstated is the confusion between population based malapportionment and seats-votes disproportionality. To understand Electoral College effects, one needs to distinguish the mechanical effects of the Electoral College that we may think of as ``malapportionment related'' (i.e., due to discrepancies between a state's EC vote share and the state's population or House delegation share), which arise simply because EC vote allocations equal the size of a state's U.S. House delegation plus the size of the state's U.S. Senate delegation, from effects that are tied to the <em>geographic</em> distribution of the votes across states in each election. The former applies throughout any given redistricting decade; the latter is election specific. The election specific effects can be substantial enough to generate a partisan bias that can lead to a divergence between popular vote majority winner and the winner of the Electoral College vote <cite id="CervasGrofman2019_SSQ">(Cervas and Grofman 2019)</cite>. <footnote>Evidence on this bias suggests that it has sometimes favored Democrats and sometimes favored Republicans <cite id="Grofman_et_al_1997__IntedgratedPerspective_ES, PattieJohnson2014, Zingher2016_bias_swingratio_JEPP"> (Grofman, Koetzle, and Brunell 1997; Pattie and Johnston 2014; Zingher 2016)</cite>. In addition to the partisan distribution of voters across states, turnout differences among the states may also operate to bias outcome so as to create a discrepancy between the popular vote winner and the EC winner. A third factor that could matter is the size of the House. In 2000, as <cite id="NeubauerZeitlin2003">Neubauer and Zeitlin (2003)</cite> point out, a larger House size might have given the election to Gore; but, given the magnitude of Trump's EC victory, the House size would have to have been increased by an implausible amount in order to switch the EC outcome in 2016 <cite id="CervasGrofman2019_SSQ">(Cervas and Grofman 2019)</cite>. Considering the relative importance of different reasons for EC and popular vote discrepancies is beyond the scope of this study.</footnote>

                    Under the shroud of uncertainty about how to weight deviations from proportionality, I, like those in comparative political science literature on vote-seats disproportionality, end with the disappointing conclusion that there appears to be no dominant measure of malapportionment that in an unbiased way captures all the inequities we may be interested in. The court's reliance on measures that look at either the range between the extremes, some ratio of the two, or the relationship between the extremes and ideal make sense exclusively as a bright-line test measuring if any malapportionment exists. A measure that looks at the individual influence of each person, such at <em>minimum population</em> needed for control or the <em>Gini coefficient</em> convey highly relevant and easily interpretive numbers. They also provide for summaries of the deviations that do not depend on institutional complexities such as the number of seats. Understanding disproportionality in the way that the economic measures do date back to at least 1896 with Vilfredo Pareto's "Cours d'รฉconomie politique", where he showed that 80% of the land in Italy was controlled by 20% of the people <cite id="Pareto1896">(Pareto 1896)</cite>. Likewise, we can show that a controlling majority (50%) of the Electoral College is held by 43% of the people. We compare this to the U.S. Senate, which in 2010, 50% of the votes is controlled by 17% of the population.

                    The Gallagher and Loosemore-Hanby are favored by students of comparative political science, their outputs do not have a clearly defined interpretation, and their respective handling of the weights of the deviations beg for context when there often is not one to give. The feature that makes the <em>Gallagher index</em> much less favorable is that it treats large deviations of a small number of constituencies differently than it treats small deviations among many seats, even if the total deviation is the same. Similarly, <em>Loosemore-Hanby</em> is sensitive to the number of districts, making it hard to compare over time.

                    Four of the measures of malapportionment (Loosemore-Hanby, Gallagher, Gini coefficient, and minimum population) range between 0 and 1. We view this as a benefite for our cognitive ability, since it allows disproportionality to be expressed as a percent. However, three of the four, excluding <em>minimum population</em>, can lead to potential paradoxes when the number of districts or the shape of the distribution changes. <footnote>Though I did not bring up the shortcomings of the <em>Gini coefficient</em>, the measure can often run into trouble when the distribution of incomes is not consisent, arising in situtations when comparing two distributions <cite id="Atkinson1970,Gastwirth1972">(Atkinson 1970; Gastwirth 1972)</cite>.</footnote>
