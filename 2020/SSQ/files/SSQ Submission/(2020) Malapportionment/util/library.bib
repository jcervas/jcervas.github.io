abstract = {Of all possible political actions the voting decision has received the most attention from behavioral political scientists. Probably we have compiled and analyzed more data on candidate choice and turnout than on any other form of political behavior. Of course, this heavy emphasis comes as no surprise. The voting act is the fundamental political act in a democracy. It is the most widespread political act. Furthermore, on the surface, at least, the voting act would appear to be one of the simplest (and therefore, most understandable) political acts. A heavy scholarly focus on the voting act follows naturally from these considerations.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}How do marginal voters differ from regular voters? This article develops a method for comparing the partisan preferences of regular voters to those marginal voters whose turnout decisions are influenced by exogenous factors and applies it to two sources of variation in turnout in the United States—weather and election timing. In both cases, marginal voters are over 20 percentage points more supportive of the Democratic Party than regular voters—a significant divide. The findings suggest that the expansion or contraction of the electorate can have important consequences. Moreover, the findings suggest that election results do not always reflect the preferences of the citizenry, because the marginal citizens who may stay home have systematically different preferences than those who participate. Finally, the methods developed in the article may enable future researchers to compare regular and marginal voters on many different dimensions and in many different electoral settings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Wang2016_SLR,
abstract = {Since the U.S. Supreme Court's Davis v. Bandemer ruling in 1986, partisan gerrymandering for statewide electoral advantage has been held to be justiciable. The existing Supreme Court standard, culminating in Vieth v. Jubelirer and LULAC v. Perry, holds that a test for gerrymandering should demonstrate both intents and effects and that partisan gerrymandering may be recognizable by its asymmetry: for a given distribution of popular votes, if the parties switch places in popular vote, the numbers of seats will change in an unequal fashion. However, the asymmetry standard is only a broad statement of principle, and no analytical method for assessing asymmetry has yet been held by the Supreme Court to be manageable. This Article proposes three statistical tests to reliably assess asymmetry in state-level districting schemes: (1) an unrepresentative distortion in the number of seats won based on expectations from nationwide district characteristics; (2) a discrepancy in winning vote margins between the two parties; and (3) the construction of reliable wins for the party in charge of redistricting, as measured by either the difference between mean and median vote share, or an unusually even distribution of votes across districts. The first test relies on computer simulation to estimate appropriate levels of representation for a given level of popular vote and provides a way to measure the effects of a gerrymander. The second and third tests, which can be used to help evaluate redistricting intent, rely on well-established statistical principles and can be carried out using a hand calculator without examination of maps or redistricting procedures. I apply these standards to a variety of districting schemes, starting from the original "Gerry-mander" of 1812, up to modern cases. In post-2010 congressional elections, partisan gerrymandering in a handful of states generated effects that are larger than the total nationwide effect of population clustering. By applying these standards in two recent cases, I show that Arizona legislative districts (Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting},

@article{Shirani-Mehr2018,
abstract = {It is well known among researchers and practitioners that election polls suffer from a variety of sampling and non-sampling errors, often collectively referred to as total survey error. Reported margins of error typically only capture sampling variability, and in particular, generally ignore non-sampling errors in defining the target popula-tion (e.g., errors due to uncertainty in who will vote). Here we empirically analyze 4,221 polls for 608 state-level presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections be-tween 1998 and 2014, all of which were conducted during the final three weeks of the campaigns. Comparing to the actual election outcomes, we find that average survey error as measured by root mean square error (RMSE) is approximately 3.5 percentage points, about twice as large as that implied by most reported margins of error. Using hierarchical Bayesian latent variable models, we decompose survey error into election-level bias and variance terms. We find average absolute election-level bias is about 1.5 percentage points, indicating that polls for a given election often share a common com-ponent of error. This shared error may stem from the fact that polling organizations often face similar difficulties in reaching various subgroups of the population, and rely on similar screening rules when estimating who will vote. We further find that aver-age election-level variance is higher than what most reported margins of error would suggest. We conclude by discussing how these results may partially explain polling failures in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and offer recommendations to improve polling practice.},

We find that approximately 20{\%} of all districts are less compact than the original gerrymander. This pattern has been fairly steady over the past 200 years, but has worsened since the 1970s. We also show a strong relationship between non-compact districts and Democratic vote share in Congressional elections; Democratic districts tend to be less compact than Republican districts.},

abstract = {An accumulating body of research suggests that African Americans cast invalid ballots at a higher rate than whites. Our analysis of a unique precinct-level dataset from South Carolina and Louisiana shows that the black-white gap in voided ballots depends crucially on the voting equipment people use. In areas with punch cards or optically scanned ballots, the black-white gap ranged from four to six percentage points. Lever and electronic machines, which prohibit overvoting and make undervoting more transparent and correctible, cut the discrepancy by a factor of ten. Judging from exit polls and opinion surveys, much of the remaining difference could be due to intentional undervoting, which African Americans profess to practice at a slightly higher rate than whites. In any case, the use of appropriate voting technologies can virtually eliminate the black-white disparity in invalid ballots.},

Seats, Votes and the Spatial Organisation of Elections provides a convincing, rigorous analysis of this disproportionality which has not been improved on since its publication over 30 years ago. Its formal analysis, illustrated by empirical examples from a range of countries, stresses the importance of three geographies as key influences on how votes are translated into seats: the geography of partisan support (where people with different political persuasions cluster); the homogeneity of those clusters; and their relative size. Its re-publication makes this classic piece of spatial (political) science available to contemporary audiences, for whom it is as relevant as when the book first appeared in 1979; Ron Johnston's introductory essay sets the work in context and identifies its importance as the foundation for three decades of subsequent work into this key feature of electoral system operation.},

abstract = {In elections with three or more candidates, coordination among like-minded voters is an important problem. We analyse the trade-off between coordination and learning about candidate quality under different temporal election systems in the context of the U.S. presidential primary system. In our model, candidates with different policy positions and qualities compete for the nomination, and voters are uncertain about the candidates' valence. This setup generates two effects: vote splitting (i.e. several candidates in the same policy position compete for the same voter pool) and voter learning (as the results in earlier elections help voters to update their beliefs on candidate quality). Sequential voting minimizes vote splitting in late districts, but voters may coordinate on a low-quality candidate. Using the parameter estimates obtained from all the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries during 2000-12, we conduct policy experiments such as replacing the current system with a simultaneous system, adopting the reform proposal of the National Association of Secretaries of State, or imposing party rules that lead to candidate withdrawal when prespecified conditions are met.},

Utilizing historical administrative data, we find that increasing proximity to previously White areas experiencing drastic Black population growth between 1940 to 1960 is associated with significant increases in aggregate White voter support for a highly racially-charged ballot measure, Proposition 14, which legally protected racial discrimination in housing. Importantly, we find that this result holds when restricting the analysis to all-White areas with high rates of residential tenure and low rates of White population growth. These latter findings indicate that this relationship materializes in contexts where a larger share of White voters were present during the treatment and exercised residential-choice before the treatment commenced, which is suggestive of a causal effect.},

In this article, we conduct the first analysis of the EG's effects on legislative representation and policymaking in the states. We first show that the partisan outcome of legislative elections has important causal effects on the ideological representation of individual districts, the ideological composition of legislative chambers, and the conservatism of state policymaking. We then show that variation in the EG across state-years is associated with systematic differences in the ideological location of the median state legislator and in the conservatism of state policies. These results suggest that partisan gerrymandering has major consequences not only for who wins elections but for the political process as a whole.},

Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article.

abstract = {Brams and Kilgour (Public Choice 170:99–113, 2017) begin their recent essay on the Electoral College (EC) by pointing out the obvious, but nonetheless regularly neglected fact that noncompetitive states may have a decisive impact on EC outcomes and shape the electoral strategies of the candidates in the competitive states, especially if there is asymmetry in the partisan balances in the non-competitive states. Their contribution is to offer combinatorics insights into the implications of such asymmetries in the form of three new indicators: Winningness, Vulnerability, and Fragility. They then explore the magnitude and effects of these three measures for the presidential elections of 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. The major contribution of this note is to extend their analyses of these measures to an additional 34 elections: every election in the modern two-party post-Civil War era from 1868 to 2016. We find the Winningness measure to predict very well over the entire set of 38 presidential elections. Inspired by their work, we also offer a new and simpler metric for partisan asymmetries in noncompetitive states and show how it can predict the expected closeness of EC outcomes as well or better than the more complex combinatorics measures they propose.},

abstract = {Controversy persists over the link between turnout and the likelihood of success of Democratic candidates (e., b). We argue that the authors in this debate have largely been talking past one another because of a failure to distinguish three quite different questions. The first question is: " Are low turnout voters more likely to vote Democratic than high turnout voters? " The second question is: " Should we expect that elections in which turnout is higher are ones in which we can expect Democrats to have done better? " The third question is the counterfactual: " If turnout were to have increased in some given election, would Democrats have done better? " We show the logical independence of the first two questions from one another and from the third, and argue that previous researchers have failed to recognize this logical independence – sometimes thinking they were answering question three when in fact they were answering either question one or question two. Reviewing previous research, we find that the answer to the first question once was YES but, for more recent elections at the presidential level, now appears to be NO, while, for congressional and legislative elections, the answer to the second question appears generally to be NO. However, the third question is essentially unanswerable absent an explicit model of why and how turnout can be expected to increase, and/or analyses of individual level panel data. Thus, the cross-sectional and pooled data analyses of previous research are of almost no value in addressing this third question.},

Methods: In the context of two parties, divide a state into two geographical areas, each of which contain a number of districts that are roughly proportional to the share of the statewide vote received by each party in the last congressional elections. Allow each party to unilaterally design the districts in a designated area of the state, restricted only by traditional districting principles. Adaptations may be made to account for more than two parties. Results: Each party gerrymanders but is limited to doing so in its designated area of the state, with results that are roughly proportional to the statewide vote. Conclusion: “Fair gerrymandering” is a way to counter unfair partisan gerrymandering and it is likely to reduce the number of uncontested elections and increase voter turnout.},

But when a self-described Muslim perpetrates a terrorist attack, do negative attitudes toward Muslims also increase? If so, is this effect conditional on the nature of people's past personal experiences with Muslims? We present natural experiment data based on a 2015 web-based survey of 2105 non-Muslims in the US, a survey that happened to span the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November and San Bernardino on 2 December. We thus test Americans' feelings toward Muslims immediately before and after both an international and a domestic terrorist attack. We find that, although the attacks significantly affected Americans' concerns about radicalism both in the US and abroad, they did not negatively affect Americans' thermometer feelings toward Muslims in the aggregate—a null finding conditioned only slightly by the nature of past personal experiences with Muslims.},

Though much has been said about this long-standing question, it is difficult to test because the concepts are nearly impossible to disentangle in modern America. Ideology and partisanship are highly correlated, only growing more so over time. However, the election of President Trump presents a unique opportunity to disentangle party attachment from ideological commitment. Using a research design that employs actual "conservative" and "liberal" policy statements from President Trump, we find that low-knowledge respondents, strong Republicans, Trump-approving respondents, and self-described conservatives are the most likely to behave like party loyalists by accepting the Trump cue-in either a liberal or conservative direction. These results suggest that there are a large number of party loyalists in the United States, that their claims to being a self-defined conservative are suspect, and that group loyalty is the stronger motivator of opinion than are any ideological principles.},

After redistricting, incumbents oftenface significant numbers of new voters-voters that were previously in a different incumbent's district. Existing conceptualizations of the incumbency advantage suggest that the cost to incumbents of having new voters should be relatively small and predictable. We propose a different formulation: a variable incumbency advantage. We argue that any incumbency advantage among the electorate is a function of short-term effects, partisanship, and electoral saliency. We use a massive untapped dataset of neighborhood-level electoral data to test our model and to demonstrate how the intersection of the personal vote, redistricting, and short-term environmental variables can provide a healthy margin to incumbents-or end their careers.},

Multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) is used to correct for this selection bias. Demographic post-stratification, similar to that used in most academic and media polls, is inadequate, but the addition of attitudinal variables (party identification, ideological self-placement, and past vote) appears to make selection ignorable in our data. We conclude that vote swings in 2012 were mostly sample artifacts and that real swings were quite small. While this account is at odds with most contemporaneous analyses,},

abstract = {Women and Politics [CAWP] 2016). However, there is also a distinct partisan skew in women's representation as the number of Democratic women in Congress far out-paces the number of Republican women. The disparity emerged in the 1992 "Year of the Woman" elections and continues to grow. In the current 114th Congress, women constitute 33 percent of the House Democratic caucus but only 9 percent of the Republican caucus (CAWP 2016). Recent scholarship rejects campaign finance as a cause of women's underrepresentation in Congress because women raise as much money as men running in similar races. However, we argue that the composition of the par-ties' electoral coalitions and the candidate-centered nature of campaign fundraising make it easier for particular candidates to run. This article provides the first in-depth examination of the gender of campaign donors giving itemized individual donations. We use a unique dataset that includes primary and general election candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 and 2012 to examine the gender composition of candidates' donor networks. Analyzing both successful and failed primary challenger, open seat, and incumbent candidates provides a better picture of the gender and partisan differences in the donor networks of male and female candidates. Given the increasing polarization of Congress and the research consensus that donors are more extreme than average voters, we also pay special attention to candidate ideology. Rather than inferring the preferences of donors through the aggregate activity of women's political action committees (PACs), we track the total amount of donations candidates receive from male and female donors. In line with previous research, we find that the ideological views of candidates are important to individual donors. Moreover, donors exhibit a gender affinity effect that is especially strong among Democrats, with female donors favoring Democratic women and male donors more likely to give to Democratic men. Furthermore, Democratic female donors appear to value the election of Abstract Recent scholarship rejects campaign finance as a cause of women's underrepresentation in Congress because women raise as much money as men running in similar races. We argue that campaign finance still impacts which women can make a run for office because candidates have to build their own donor networks. Using a unique dataset that includes primary and general election candidates for the U.S. House in 2010 and 2012, we examine the gender composition of candidates' donor networks. We find that candidates' ideological views are very important to contributors. Donors, particularly Democrats, also exhibit a gender affinity effect in which men give more to male candidates and women favor female candidates. Furthermore, female Democratic donors seem to value the election of women, especially liberal Democratic women, over other traditional predictors of giving, such as incumbency and competitiveness. Meanwhile, Republican male and female donors do not focus on candidate gender, and female Republican donors prefer conservative candidates. Thus, the existing partisan donor pools are friendlier to the emergence of liberal female Democrats than Republican women.},

Building on this nascent literature and work on black political participation, we show that redistricting's negative effects on participation—measured by voter roll-off in U.S. House elections—are generally strongest among African Americans, but that black voters can be mobilized when they are redrawn into a black representative's congressional district. Our findings, based on data from 11 postredistricting elections in five states from 1992 through 2006, both expand the empirical scope of previous work and suggest that redistricting plays a previously hidden role in affecting black participation in congressional contests.},

Employing two different datasets and various measures of globalization, we analyze whether globalization has indeed influenced the composition of government expenditures. For a sample of 108 countries, we examine the development of four broad expenditure categories for the period 1970-2001: capital expenditures; expenditures for goods and services; interest payments; and subsidies and other current transfers. A second dataset provides a much more detailed classification: public expenditures, expenditures for defence, order, economic environment, housing, health, recreation, education, and social expenditures. However, this second data set is only available since 1990 - and only for the OECD countries. Our results show that globalization did not influence the composition of government expenditures.},

We find that even after allowing for fixed state effects, year effects, and common random shocks among neighbors, a state government's level of per capita expenditure is positively and significantly affected by the expenditure levels of its neighbors. Ceteris paribus, a one dollar increase in a state's neighbors' expenditures increases its own expenditure by over 70 cents.},

@article{Johnston2005,
abstract = {The 2000 and 2004 US Presidential elections were closely fought contests, with in the first case victory in the Electoral College being denied to the candidate with the largest share of the popular vote. Disproportionality in the translation of votes into seats (in this case, from popular votes to votes in the Electoral College) is common to contests using a winner-takes-all electoral system. So is bias, whereby that disproportionality does not apply equally to each candidate. Analysis of the bias at those two elections shows that Bush was favoured at the first but not at the second. Identification of the bias components shows that Bush was advantaged by variations in the number of popular votes per Electoral College voter across the states, and also by variation in turnout. In 2000, his popular votes were also more efficiently distributed than Gore's; in 2004 they were less efficiently distributed than Kerry's, largely because of increased turnout - producing larger numbers of surplus votes - in states that were already safe for Bush. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Predictive models aim to specify a probabilistic model that provides a good fit to testing data that were not used to estimate the model's parameters. Our goals are threefold. First, we review the central benefits of this under-utilized approach from a perspective uncommon in the existing literature: we focus on how predictive modeling can be used to complement and augment standard associational analyses. Second, we advance the state of the literature by laying out a simple set of benchmark predictive criteria.

abstract = {We show that the median legislator in the US House is unambiguously closer to the majority party median than to the minority party median. An important implication of this finding is that the median legislator is predisposed to support the majority party's policy agenda. Thus, in the event that the majority party organization exerts no influence over the legislative process, and in the event that all policies then default to the legislative median, policy outcomes will still substantially favor the majority party over the minority. We demonstrate that the legislative median moves predictably toward the majority party in response to changes in majority control and the size and ideological homogeneity of the two parties. Consequently, the median legislators' partisan predisposition increases and decreases in response to electoral change. We conclude that partisan and floor majority, or median, theories of lawmaking are more often complementary than conflicting, and that party activities in the electoral arena have implications for legislative partisanship.},

The incumbency advantage has diminished in conjunction with an increase in party loyalty, straight-ticket voting, and president-centered electoral nationalization, products of the widening and increasingly coherent partisan divisions in the American electorate. Consequently, House incumbents now have a much harder time retaining districts that lean toward the rival party. Democrats had been the main beneficiaries of the denationalization of electoral politics that had enabled the incumbency advantage to grow, and they have thus been the main victims of the reemergence of a more party-centered electoral process. Republicans enjoy a long-standing structural advantage in the distribution of partisans across districts, so this trend has strengthened their grip on the House even as they have become less competitive in contests for the presidency.},

abstract = {Despite an electoral system that appears to present excellent opportunities for women to win elective office, the number of women candidates remains low. While the initial decision to run for office is critical in understanding women's continued under-representation in elective office, very little research explores this subject. To examine the manner in which gender affects the decision to seek an elective position, we investigated how men and women in the "pool of eligible candidates" in New York State perceived running for office. Two central findings emerged from our data. First, contrary to findings in previous research, women and men in our sample expressed roughly equal levels of political ambition and viewed the campaign environment similarly. Our second central finding, however, is that important gender differences emerged in the factors that contributed to the decision to run. In other words, women considered many more factors when thinking about running for office, whereas men of all types felt more freedom to launch a candidacy. These findings tend to reinforce the notion that broad patterns of sex-role socialization continue to impede women from full inclusion in the electoral process.},

abstract = {Objectives: We offer a typology of possible reforms to the Electoral College (EC) in terms of changes to its two most important structural features: seat allocations that are not directly proportional to population and winner-take-all outcomes at the state level. This typology allows us to classify four major variants of “reform” to the present EC in a parsimonious fashion. Many of the proposals we consider have been suggested by well-known figures, some debated in Congress, and they include what we view as most likely to be taken seriously. We evaluate these proposals solely in terms of one simple criterion: “Would they be expected to reduce the likelihood of inversions between EC and popular vote outcomes?”. Methods: We answer this question by looking at the data on actual presidential election outcomes at the state level over the entire period 1868–2016, and at the congressional-district level over the period 1956–2016. We consider the implications for presidential outcomes of these different alternative mechanisms, in comparison to the actual electoral outcome and the popular vote outcome. In addition, we consider the implications of a proposal to increase the size of the U.S. House (Ladewig and Jasinski, 2008). Results: Our results show that inversions from the popular vote happen under all proposed alternatives at nearly the same rate as under the current EC rules, with some proposals actually making inversions more frequent. Conclusions: The major difference between the present EC rule and alternative rules is not in frequency of inversions, but is in which particular years the inversions occur. As for the proposal to increase the size of the House, we show that any realistic increase in House size would have made no difference for the 2016 outcome.},

abstract = {This paper explores the racial origins and legacy of the Electoral College through historical and quantitative analyses. At the Constitutional Convention, the Electoral College served the interests of Southern slaveowners by perpetu- ating the advantage of the Three-Fifths Compromise. Following Reconstruction, Southern states that disenfranchised African Americans received an even larger voice in the Electoral College. Republicans tried to counter these moves by admit- ting unusually small states into the union. The ironic consequence of this non- racial decision is that, today, these states are heavily White and have citizens with higher levels of racial resentment. A MM-regression analysis of every elec- tion from 2000 on indicates the Electoral College has consistently awarded more votes per capita to states with Whiter populations and more racially conserva- tive attitudes. The racially-disparate power exerted by these states makes it more difficult to enact racially-egalitarian policies. This paper adds a new perspective to the normative debate over the Electoral College, which typically focuses on democratic fairness and federalism concerns.},

abstract = {Polarization and gridlock are defining characteristics of present-day American national politics, reflecting the interaction of the Madisonian system's checks and balances with the widening partisan and ideological divisions in the House and Senate. These divisions have coevolved with complimentary changes in electoral politics over the same period in a mutually reinforcing spiral. The partisan, ideological, and policy opinions of American voters have grown more internally consistent, more distinctive between parties, and more predictive of voting in national elections. Party loyalty has increased, ticket splitting has decreased, and winning congressional seats against the local partisan grain has become much more difficult. The congressional parties thus represent increasingly divergent electoral constituencies. Republicans enjoy a structural advantage in the distribution of their regular voters across House districts, so these changes have solidified their control of the House even as their national party grows less competitive nationally. Divided government and polarized politics thus rest on a firm electoral base, and partisan warfare in Washington is unlikely to diminish until voters begin to punish the warriors.

We reexamine this debate and argue that one has to take the different levels on which the causal mechanisms are located into account. This leads to a novel reformulation of Rokkan's hypotheses: we claim that PR is introduced when legislators face strong district-level competition and when their parties expect to gain seats from a change of the electoral law. In the empirical part, we model legislators' support for the PR adoption and evaluate the relative importance of district-level competition and vulnerability resulting from electoral inroads made by Social Democratic candidates; partisan calculations arising from disproportionalities in the allocation of votes to seats; and economic conditions at the district-level, specifically variation in skill profiles. Support for the adoption of PR is explained by a combination of district vulnerabilities and seat-vote disproportionality.},

The methodological status and the viability of this very common procedure are unclear and are worth examining. How does the strategy of counterfactual argument relate, if at all, to methods of hypothesis testing based on the comparison of actual cases, such as regression analysis or Mill's Method of Difference? Are counterfactual thought experiments a viable means of assessing hypotheses about national and international outcomes, or are they methodologically invalid in principle? The paper addresses the first question in some detail and begins discussion of the second. Examples from work on the causes of World War I, the nonoccurrence of World War III, social revolutions, the breakdown of democratic regimes in Latin America, and the origins of fascism and corporatism in Europe illustrate the use, problems and potential of counterfactual argument in small-N-oriented political science research.},

Defining momentum as the impact election outcomes have on candidate support above and beyond existing trends and leveraging a rolling cross section of more than 325,000 interviews to examine daily changes in candidate support in the 2016 nomination contests reveal scant evidence that primary election outcomes uniquely affect respondents' preferences over the competing candidates. Preferences sometimes respond to election outcomes, but the estimated effects are indistinguishable from effects occurring on nonelection days. There is also no evidence that those who should be most receptive to new information are more affected by election outcomes. As a result, our investigation strongly suggests that election outcomes are not uniquely important for affecting opinions and shaping the outcome of nomination contests.},

Yet there has been almost no previous research on the policy effects of the partisan composition of county governments. Most counties in the United States have small legislatures, usually called commissions or councils, that set their budgets and other policies. In this study, we examine whether counties with Democratic legislators spend more than counties with Republican ones. We assemble an original data set of 10,708 elections in approximately 298 medium and large counties over the past 25 years. Based on a regression discontinuity design, we find that electing a Democratic legislator rather than a Republican one leads the average county to increase spending by about 5{\%}. Overall, our findings contribute to a growing literature on the policy consequences of partisan control of state and local government. They show that the partisan selection of county legislators has important policy effects in county governments.},

In so doing, our analysis resolves two long-standing controversies in American politics. First, whereas some w scholars believe that redistricting reduces electoral responsiveness by protecting incumbents, others, that the relationship is spurious, we demonstrate that both sides are wrong: redistricting increases responsiveness. Second, while some researchers believe that gerrymandering dramatically increases partisan bias and others deny this effect, we show both sides are in a sense correct. Gerrymandering biases electoral systems in favor of the party that controls the redistricting as compared to what would have happened if the other party controlled it, but any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an electoral system without redistricting. Incorrect conclusions in both literatures resulted from misjudging the enormous uncertainties present during redistricting periods, making simplified assumptions about the redistricters' goals, and using inferior statistical methods.},

In particular, examining historical and geographic patterns in terms of changes in the number of divided US Senate delegations (i.e., states whose two senators are of different parties) is a useful route to testing competing models of American politics, including theories of split-ticket voting, party polarization, and realignment. Brunell and Grofman (1998) used divided Senate delegations to indirectly examine evidence for realignment. We hypothesized that a partisan realignment will necessarily lead to a cyclical pattern in the number of divided Senate delegations. We predicted that the number of divided Senate delegations at the state level would decline after 1996 because we conjectured that there had been a realignment cusp around 1980. We tested this prediction with data from 1952–2016 and our prediction was confirmed.},

We argue that steep progressive income and estate taxation may have prevented large fortunes from fully recovering from these shocks. Top wage shares were at before World War II, dropped precipitously during the war, and did not start to recover before the late 1960s but are now higher than before World War II. As a result, the working rich have replaced the rentiers at the top of the income distribution.},

Such a focus, however, omits a key point: electoral rules also distribute power among geographic units. If, within a party, the partisan and geographic interests of some members conflict, then the canonical relationship between partisanship and rule choice may be conditional. The U.S. electoral college provides an opportunity to test for such intra-party variation, because it advantages some states over others and thus makes salient geographic allegiances. Using an original dataset on one reform proposal—the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)—I find evidence of competing loyalties. Although NPVIC advances furthest when Democrats control state lawmaking, a state's status as a swing—but not as an overrepresented—state weakens the relationship to the point where even Democrats are unlikely to aid NPVIC.},

abstract = {We review a number of different statistical techniques for creating seats-votes curves and apply the most reliable of these to estimate seats-votes relationships in the US electoral college 1900-1992. We consider the now rejected claim, once firmly established as part of the common journalistic and even academic wisdom, that the US Electoral College has recently been strongly biased in favor of Republicans, and show that this claim was based largely on a confusion between bias (asymmetry in the electoral college gains earned by the votes received by different parties or candidates) and swing ratio (responsiveness of change in electoral college seat share to change in popular vote). Although there has been substantial bias during this century in the way the electoral college translates Democratic and Republican votes into electoral college seats, and for the earlier party of this century (from 1900 to 1940) that bias has been in favor of Republicans, to explain why many recent electoral college majorities have been so lopsided we must look not at bias but at swing ratio. We show that the swing ratio in the electoral college has generally been increasing since 1900, rising from an average value (1900-1924) around three to an average value (1976-1992) ranging from about five to about eight, depending upon which of the various statistical estimation techniques we use. Thus, for every one point vote share gain above 50 per cent, a winning presidential candidate in a two-candidate competition can now expect to pick up somewhere between a 5 percentage point and an 8 percentage point increase in electoral college seats - giving the illusion of mandate even for relatively close contests and frequently creating apparent landslides. We show that this historical rise in swing ratio in presidential elections is due almost entirely to changes in the responsiveness of outcomes in the US South as the influence of the Civil War slowly (very slowly) erodes. Drawing on the analysis of the determinants of bias and of swing ratio in the House of Representatives in Brady and Grotman (1991b), we show that the increases in electoral college swing can be accounted for by the nationalization of presidential competition as signaled by the decrease over time in the standard deviation of Democratic share of the two-party vote across states, and that changes in bias can be linked to changes in the magnitude of differences between the mean and the median of that distribution. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Under this new system, all candidates regardless of party affiliation run against each other, narrowing the field down to the top two for the general election. In some jurisdictions, the general election features two candidates from the same party. Ten percent of California voters chose not to vote in the 2016 U.S. Senate election which featured two Democrats. Using data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (2012–2016), I find that among those who vote in the national November elections, orphans, or voters without a copartisan candidate on the ballot are more likely to undervote, opting out of voting in their congressional race. Levels of undervoting are nearly 20 percentage points higher for orphaned voters compared to non-orphaned voters. Additionally, voters who abstain perceive more ideological distance between themselves and the candidates compared to voters who cast a vote. These findings support a multi-step framework for vote decisions in same-party matchups: voters are more likely to undervote if they are unable to vote for a candidate from their party (partisan model), but all voters are more likely to vote for a candidate when they perceive ideological proximity (ideological model).},

But, critically, we demonstrate through a simulation study that the estimated partisan bias in moving choices is on the order of five times too small to sustain the current geographic polarization of preferences.

Pivotal states identified by this approach generally conform to popular interpretationsDLOhio in 2004, Florida in 2000, and so forth - but, historically, pivotal states are also frequently small or medium-sized states. Also, pivotal states by this approach are not necessarily competitive states. In general, whether or not a state is pivotal is mainly a function of its size and bellwether tendency - i.e., its tendency to mirror the national voting trend. A state's pivot position is also an excellent predictor of how presidential candidates allocated time and money across states in the general elections of 2000 and 2004. Controlling for a state's pivot position, size and electoral competitiveness have little effect on the allocation of campaign resources. Reprinted by permission of Springer},

Through a rigorous scientific analysis of US House district maps, the authors argue that partisan bias increased dramatically in the 2010 redistricting round after the Vieth decision, both at the national and state level. From a constitutional perspective, unrestrained partisan gerrymandering poses a critical threat to a central pillar of American democracy, popular sovereignty. State legislatures now effectively determine the political composition of the US House. The book answers the Court's challenge to find a new standard for gerrymandering that is both constitutionally grounded and legally manageable. It argues that the scientifically rigorous partisan symmetry measure is an appropriate legal standard for partisan gerrymandering, as it logically implies the constitutional right to individual equality and can be practically applied.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} How do electoral rules affect the composition of governments? It is a robust finding that countries with majoritarian rules more often elect conservative governments than those with proportional representation (PR) electoral systems. There are three explanations for this pattern. The first stresses the impact of voting behaviour: the middle class more often votes for right-wing parties in majoritarian electoral systems, anticipating governments' redistributive consequences. The second explanation is based on electoral geography: the regional distribution of votes may bias the vote-seat translation against the Left in majoritarian systems due to the wide margins by which the Left wins core urban districts. The third explanation refers to party fragmentation: if the Right is more fragmented than the Left in countries with PR, then there is less chance of a right-wing party gaining {\textless}italic{\textgreater}formateur{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} status. This study tests these three hypotheses for established democracies over the entire post-war period. It finds the first two mechanisms at work in the democratic chain of delegation from voting via the vote-seat translation to the formation of cabinets, while party fragmentation does not seem to co-vary as much as expected with electoral rules. These findings confirm that majoritarian systems have a substantive conservative bias, whereas countries with PR show more differentiated patterns. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This article theorizes the colonial problem of peoplehood that Indian anticolonial thinkers grappled with in their attempts to conceptualize self-rule, or swaraj. British colonial rule drew its legitimacy from a developmentalist conception of the colonized people as backward and disunited. The discourse of “underdeveloped” colonial peoplehood rendered the Indian people “unfit” for self-government, suspending their sovereignty to an indefinite future. The concept of swaraj would be born with the rejection of deferred colonial self-government. Yet the persistence of the developmentalist figuration of the people generated a crisis of sovereign authorization. The pre-Gandhian swaraj theorists would be faced with the not-yet claimable figure of the people at the very moment of disavowing the British claim to rule. Recovering this underappreciated pre-Gandhian history of the concept of swaraj and reinterpreting its Gandhian moment, this article offers a new reading of Gandhi's theory of moral self-rule. In so doing, it demonstrates how the history of swaraj helps trace the colonial career of popular sovereignty.},

We hypothesize that increased exposure to campaign stimuli may provide lower income voters in the contested states with an appreciable advantage over those in the "blackout" states by underwriting the costs associated with becoming engaged. Our findings show that the condition of living on contested electoral terrain does have a positive impact on the political interest and engagement levels of lower income voters. The results reinforce the importance of the political campaign as an instrument of democracy. Modern campaign strategies can diversify the electorate in meaningful ways, but the influence of the campaign is also limited by the narrow geographic targeting of party resources.},

abstract = {We discuss uses of social science definitions and research methods in judging compliance with the recently modified language of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That Act now specifies a “totality of circumstances” effects lest for the existence of racial vote dilution. There are seven “typical” factors listed by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in its report on the 1982 Voting Rights extension as among those which may be used to establish a Section 2 violation. Because of the nature of these factors, extensive (and often conflicting) testimony by social scientists has now become an inescapable feature of Section 2 litigation. We focus particular attention on one of the seven factors, racially polarized voting, because measurement of it is, as judged by recent litigation, the most controversial, the most complex, and the most important. We also discuss at some length another factor, racial campaign appeals, which also raises issues of appropriate definition and measurement. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a standardization of terminology and operationalization in an important public policy area, and to show how social science methodology can assist legal fact‐finding.

Bishop argued this has increased as the result of residential location decisions: Democratic Party supporters have increasingly moved to neighborhoods where others of that persuasion are already congregated, for example. His analyses at the county scale are geographically incommensurate with that argument, however; the lacuna is filled using precinct-level data for the entire United States for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Multi-level modelling shows polarization at those elections was significantly greater at the precinct than the county, state and division scales. Change over the three elections at the precinct scale was probably associated with redistricting and reduced support from the Democratic Party by some groups.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although conditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don'ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10{\%} of the articles in our survey followed the checklist. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Political Methodology.

In a comprehensive analysis of these statewide elections since 1928, we find that the conventional theory was true outside the South through 1964, but since 1965 the overall relationship between turnout and partisan outcomes has been insignificant. Even before the mid-1960s, the turnout effect outside the South was strongest in Republican states and insignificant or negative in heavily Democratic states. A similar but weaker pattern obtains after 1964. In the South, which we analyze only since 1966, higher turnout helped Republicans until 1990, but in 1990-94 the effect became pro-Democratic. The conventional theory cannot account for these complex patterns, but they are impressively consistent with DeNardo's (1980) theory},

Drawing on a new database of 165,000 bills—covering sessions over 120 years in thirteen different states—we demonstrate the surprising prominence of particularistic bills affecting a specific legislator's district. We then develop and test a theory linking the goals of legislators to their propensity to introduce district bills rather than broad legislation. We find that, consistent with our predictions, politicians are more likely to craft policies targeted to a particular local interest when a legislature is dominated by one party or when it pays its members relatively high salaries. These findings provide empirical support for Key's (1949) thesis that one-party politics descends into factionalism and undermines the making of broad public policy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {When political scientists present empirical results, they are much more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that graphs greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear and correct inferences. Using a sample of leading journals, we document this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables. We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results. We illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression results. We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs would improve the discipline's communicative output and make empirical findings more accessible to every type of audience. W hile political science is a diverse field whose practitioners employ a variety of methodologies and tools, a significant portion of the discipline's output includes the study of data and drawing inferences from statistical analyses. As such, the conclusions one draws from political science papers, books, and presentations often hinge on the successful communication of the data a researcher is using and the inferences she is drawing from them. Yet, much more often than not, political scientists choose to present empirical results in the form of tables rather than using graphical displays, a tendency that weakens the clarity of presentation and makes it more difficult for a reader to draw clear and correct inferences. In this paper we seek to highlight the discipline's reliance on tables and to offer suggestions for how to use graphs instead of tables to improve the presentation of empirical results. Six years ago, King et al.'s influential paper urged social scientists to present quantities of interest rather than parameter estimates from statistical analyses. 1 Our paper follows up on this effort. We seek to move beyond what researchers should communicate to their audience by offering suggestions on how they should do so. 2 Other scholars have made similar recommendations. 3 But, as we show, political scientists are not heeding the advice to use graphs. 4 Following the example of Gelman et al., we went through every article from five issues of three leading political science journals-the February and May 2006 American Political Science Review, the July 2006 American Journal of Political Science and the Winter and Spring 2006 issues of Political Analysis 5-and counted the number of tables and graphs presented in each. 6 We also analyzed the basic characteristics and purpose of each table and graph to get a sense of how researchers use them to communicate empirical results. This undertaking led to two main conclusions. First, political scientists rely on tables far more than graphs-twice as often, in fact. Second, tables are used mainly to present data summaries and the results of regression models. Indeed, tables presenting parameter estimates and standard errors comprised about 50 percent of the tables in our sample. In addition, we found that political scientists never use graphs to present regression results. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate directly how researchers can use graphs to improve the quality of empirical presentations. Unlike previous attempts to promote the use of graphs, we devote a significant portion of our analysis to showing how graphs can greatly improve the communication of regression results, which are almost always presented in tables whose features can strain even the most seasoned journal reader. Rather than presenting an abstract review of the benefits of graphs, we take a sample of tables from the various journal issues and turn Jonathan P. Kastellec (jpk2004@columbia.edu) and Edu-ardo L.

@article{OwenGrofman1984,
abstract = {One paradox of voting states that, in a general election, in which many citizens vote, the probability that a single voter can affect the outcome is so small that in general citizens have no rational reason for voting. However, if all citizens accept this reasoning, then none will vote, and so each vote has a large probability of affecting the outcome. Hence all should vote after all. The adoption of mixed strategies resolves this paradox: if each citizen adopts a certain (small) probability of voting, then the actual number of citizens voting will be just enough to make it worth those citizens' while to vote. A Nash equilibrium point thus occurs. Here we compute Nash equilibria for the simple case of majority voting; for the more complicated case of composite voting (for example, as in a presidential election), we draw certain qualitative inferences.},

After Obama's historic election in 2008, a small cadre of Republican operatives began plotting the party's comeback with a simple yet ingenious plan. These men had devised a way to take a tradition of dirty tricks-- known to political insiders as "ratf**king"-- to a whole new, unprecedented level. Flooding state races with a gold rush of dark money made possible by Citizens United, the Republicans reshaped state legislatures, where the power to redistrict is held. Daley examines the far-reaching effects of this so-called REDMAP program, which has radically altered America's electoral map and created a firewall in the House, insulating the party and its wealthy donors from popular democracy.

abstract = {What is the minimum black population necessary to elect African-American state lawmakers? We offer the most comprehensive examination of the election of black state legislators in the post-Thornburg v. Gingles (1986) era. We begin by charting changes in the partisan affiliation of state legislators and the percentage of black legislators from 1971 to 2016. This descriptive assessment is undertaken according to important regional (Non-South and South) and subregional (Rim South and Deep South) contexts in American politics. We then perform multivariate analyses of the likelihood of electing black legislators across three periods following the marked increase in the creation of majority-minority districts (1993–1995, 2003–2005, 2013–2015). Because of sectional variation in the partisan strength of the major parties, the probability of achieving black representation is significantly different depending upon whether a contest occurs in the Non-South, Rim South, or Deep South, with the latter constituting of the highest threshold of black population necessary to elect an African-American. By merging an original dataset on state legislative elections with the most complete evaluation of the factors shaping the election of black lawmakers, our findings shed new light on minority representation and how sectional differences greatly affect the electoral success of African-Americans.},

From 1982 to 1992 the Republican party realized no gains in open seat elections, despite continued protestations that the Democratic party incumbency advantage prevented the growth of Republican representation. Methods. This note examines open seat U.S. House elections from 1982 to 1992 to determine whether there is an inherent Democratic party advantage in congressional elections in the absence of incumbency. Results. Democratic party candidates obtained larger electoral benefits from political experience than their Republican opponents, and were advantaged by the presence of substantial minority populations in congressional districts, supporting the concept of an inherent electoral advantage. Conclusions. The prospects for expanded Republican representation depended on minimizing the differences in experience between Democratic and Republican candidates, establishing substantial spending advantages, and limiting the impact of minority populations to as few congressional districts as possible. Republicans derived some benefits from displacing minority populations in the South in 1992, although the effects were not sufficient to offset weak Republican presidential coattails and the presence of well-financed, experienced Democratic candidates.},

Thus, an extensive survey of examples—grouped and discussed to highlight how and why they provide the leverage they do—may help scholars to use natural experiments effectively in their substantive research. Just as impor- tantly, awareness of the obstacles to successful natural experiments may help scholars maximize their promise while avoiding their pitfalls. There are significant challenges involved in the analysis and interpretation of natural- experimental data. Moreover, the growing popularity of natural experiments can lead to conceptual stretching, as the label is applied to studies that do not very credibly bear the hallmarks ofthis research design. Discussion ofboth the strengths and limitations of natural experiments may help readers to evaluate and bolster the success ofspecific applications.

In this paper, I focus on one aspect of representative democracy: the formation of electoral district boundaries. It is well known that majoritarian systems give rise to highly biased seat–vote curves, causing representation to be less than ideal. What should, therefore, be the optimal constituency design when the objective is to maximize voters' welfare? I show that when parties take account of districting while setting platforms, then the district design problem reduces to a very simple rule: do nothing when voters are risk neutral, and — when voters are risk averse — choose a bias that is against the largest partisan group. Calibrating the model on data of the U.S. State legislative elections during the 1990s, I show that the welfare gain due to optimal districting is very small.},

abstract = {Debate continues on the effect of disc degeneration and aging on disc volume and shape. So far, no quantitative in vivo MRI data is available on the factors influencing disc volume and shape. The objective of this MRI study was to quantitatively investigate changes in disc height, volume, and shape as a result of aging and/or degeneration omitting pathologic (i.e., painful) disc alterations. Seventy asymptomatic volunteers (20-78 years) were investigated with sagittal T1- and T2-weighted MR-images encompassing the whole lumbar spine. Disc height was determined by the Dabbs method and the Farfan index. Disc volume was calculated by the Cavalieri method. For the disc shape the "disc convexity index" was calculated by the ratio of central disc height and mean anterior/posterior disc height. Disc height, disc volume, and the disc convexity index measurements were corrected for disc level and the individuals age, weight, height, and sex in a multilevel regression analysis. Multilevel regression analysis showed that disc volume was negatively influenced by disc degeneration (p {\textless} 0.001) and positively correlated with body height (p {\textless} 0.001) and age (p {\textless} 0.01). Mean disc height and the disc convexity index were negatively influenced by disc degeneration but not by gender, weight, and height. Disc height was positively correlated with age (p {\textless} 0.01). From the results of this study, it can be concluded that disc degeneration generally results in a decrease of disc height and volume as well as a less convex disc shape. In the absence of disc degeneration, however, age tends to result in an inverse relationship on disc height, volume, and shape.},

abstract = {We estimate bias and responsiveness in 1980 and 1982 congressional elections for the nation as a whole and for states grouped according to control of the governorship and state legislature and according to legislative versus court control of the redistricting process. We find that in states where one party controlled the redistricting process, partisan bias moved in a direction favoring the party controlling the redistricting, but the effect was large only for states under unified party control. However, at the national level, redistricting was almost a wash, with a slight pro-Democratic bias in 1982 which was lower than that in 1980. These findings contradict views widely expressed in the national press about a strong pro-Democratic national gerry- mander, and also contradict the findings of Abramowitz (1983) that partisan bias in 1980s con- gressional redistricting was important only in Democratic-controlled states. We show that Abramowitz's conclusions rest on an improper method of estimating bias, one that confounds bias and responsiveness (swing).},

In this paper we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to fit a Bayesian measurement model of ideal points for all justices serving on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1953 through 1999. We are particularly interested in determining to what extent ideal points of justices change throughout their tenure on the Court. This is important because judicial politics scholars oftentimes invoke preference measures that are time invariant. To investigate preference change, we posit a dynamic item response model that allows ideal points to change systematically over time. Additionally, we introduce Bayesian methods for fitting multivariate dynamic linear models to political scientists. Our results suggest that many justices do not have temporally constant ideal points. Moreover, our ideal point estimates outperform existing measures and explain judicial behavior quite well across civil rights, civil liberties, economics, and federalism cases.},

A first approach tests hypotheses about the relationship between citizens' opinions and elites' positions on multiple individual issues. A second approach first estimates individual citizens' and elites' ideological orientations across issue areas and tests hypotheses with the resulting ‘ideology scores.' I argue this latter approach has under-appreciated flaws, as citizens' ‘ideology scores' primarily measure their ideological consistency across policy domains not their views within domains. Consistent with these concerns, citizens with moderate scores on ideological scales appear no more likely to support moderate policies. Applications then illustrate how ideological measures can mislead the study of representation: for example, contrary to a growing conventional wisdom, legislators appear no more likely to support extreme policies than citizens.},

abstract = {What is the effect of gerrymandering on the partisan outcomes of United States Congressional elections? A major challenge to answering this question is in determining the outcomes that would have resulted in the absence of gerrymandering. Since we only observe Congressional elections where the districts have potentially been gerrymandered, we lack a non-gerrymandered counterfactual that would allow us to isolate its true effect. To overcome this challenge, we conduct computer simulations of the districting process to redraw the boundaries of Congressional districts without partisan intent. By estimating the outcomes of these non-gerrymandered districts, we are able to establish the non-gerrymandered counterfactual against which the actual outcomes can be compared. The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in Congress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan districting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors other than partisan intent in the districting process.},

abstract = {The electoral college method of electing the President and Vice President was established in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution and revised by the Twelfth Amendment. It provides for election of the President and Vice President by electors, commonly referred to as the electoral college. A majority of 270 of the 538 electoral votes is necessary to win. For further information on the modern-day operation of the college system, see CRS Report RL32611, The Electoral College: How It Works in Contemporary Presidential Elections, by Thomas H. Neale. The electoral college has been the subject of criticism and proposals for reform since before 1800. Constitutional and structural criticisms have centered on several of its features: (1) although today all electors are chosen by the voters in the presidential election, it is claimed to be not fully democratic, since it provides indirect election of the President; (2) it can lead to the election of candidates who win the electoral college but fewer popular votes than their opponents, or to contingent election in Congress if no candidate wins an electoral college majority; (3) it results in electoral vote under-and over-representation for some states between censuses; and (4) " faithless " electors can vote for candidates other than those they were elected to support. Legislative and political criticisms include (1) the general ticket system, currently used in all states except Maine and Nebraska, which is alleged to disenfranchise voters who prefer the losing candidates in the states; (2) various asserted " biases " that are alleged to favor different states and groups; and (3) the electoral college " lock, " which has been claimed to provide an electoral college advantage to both major parties at different times.},

Two survey experiments reveal how citizen evaluations of elite responsiveness to constituent mail are conditioned by gender and sexist attitudes. The findings suggest that a double bind does exist in legislator–constituent communication, even among people who have positive views of women. For instance, although the least sexist respondents favor communication from female legislators regardless of the quality of communication, they also punish women, but not men, for taking longer to respond to constituent mail. Male legislators are also more likely to be rewarded for being friendly as respondents' sexism increases, but female legislators do not enjoy the same advantage, likely due to gender stereotypes and expectations regarding women's behavior.},

We find that the governing parties skew the distribution of funds in favor of areas that provide them with the strongest electoral support. This is borne out in two ways. (i) Counties that traditionally give the highest vote share to the governing party receive larger shares of state transfers to local governments. (ii) When control of the state government changes, the distribution of funds shifts in the direction of the new governing party. We find only weak evidence that parties reward electorally pivotal counties or counties in electorally pivotal legislative districts. Finally, we find that increased spending in a county increases voter turnout in subsequent elections. This suggests that parties have an electoral incentive to skew the distribution of funds to influence future election results, and the mechanism through which this works is "mobilization" rather than "conversion" of voters in a fixed electorate.},

Much evidence suggests that the politics of the 1960s and 1970s differ substantially from those of the Eisenhower era on which the parameters estimated by Philip Converse were based, implying a need for their reassessment. This report presents newly calculated turnout and partisanship parameters for the normal vote model based on data from the Center for Political Studies six national election surveys from 1962 to 1972. The theoretical significance of the new parameters and the methodological and statistical consequences of applying the old rather than the new parameters to normal vote analysis of recent elections are discussed. Among other results, the research reveals a systematic overestimation of the long-term component, and the reciprocal underestimation of the importance of the short-term component, when normal vote analysis of recent election data is performed with the fifties parameters rather than with the new parameters.]},

This renders the bargaining over portfolios an important phase of the government formation process.

This article focuses on this qualitative aspect of portfolio allocation and uses a new comparative dataset to evaluate a number of hypotheses that can be drawn from the literature. The main hypothesis is that parties which, in their election manifestos, emphasise themes corresponding to the policy remit of specific cabinet portfolios are more likely to obtain control over these portfolios.

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature - defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all. Because real-world redistricting and gerrymandering involve complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.},

abstract = {Many advocate for political reforms intended to resolve apparent disjunctures between politicians' ideologically polarized policy positions and citizens' less polarized policy preferences. We show these apparent disjunctures can arise even when politicians represent their constituencies well and that resolving them would likely degrade representation. These counterintuitive results arise from a paradox whereby polarized politicians can best represent constituencies composed of citizens with idiosyncratic preferences. We document this paradox among US House members, often criticized for excessive polarization. We show that if House members represented their constituencies' preferences as closely as possible, they would still appear polarized. Moreover, current members nearly always represent their constituencies better than counterfactual less polarized members. A series of experiments confirms that even "moderate" citizens usually prefer ostensibly polarized representatives to many less polarized alternatives. E lite polarization is said to have given rise to a "discon-nect" in how politicians represent voters (e.g., Fiorina and Abrams 2009). According to this widespread view, citizens are overwhelmingly ideologically moderate but are represented by ideologically extreme politicians, who are termed "polarized." Not only has understanding the causes of elite polarization become a focus of scholarly inquiry, but major reforms are being carried out in hope of remedying it. These include changes to parties, campaign finance, elections, and more (e.g., Mann and Ornstein 2013). In this article, we show that remedying this apparent ideological "disconnect" between politicians and voters would likely degrade the quality of political representation. Moreover, we show that this apparent "disconnect" would arise even if politicians represented their constituencies' policy preferences as well as possible. These counterintuitive results arise from a novel paradox we identify whereby constituencies comprising citizens with idiosyncratic policy preferences are often best represented by politicians who appear ideologically polarized. We call this the Delegate Paradox, because representatives who represent their constituencies as closely as possible on every issue can appear polarized and out of step ideologically. To appreciate this Delegate Paradox, consider a single representative in the US House, Adam Schiff of California's Twenty-Ninth Congressional District. Five actual constituents of this district who responded to the 2009 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) are depicted in table 1. The CCES asked these constituents how they would have voted on five proposals Congress also voted on that year. In terms of the measured left-right ideology calculated from their views on these issues, these five constituents are the median five respondents in that district. 1 They all answered more questions in a manner indicating a liberal view than a conservative view. As a consequence, all five appear just left of center on an ideological continuum calculated from their preferences on these bills. However, like most citizens, these constituents espouse various mixes of liberal and conservative preferences across these bills. In the terminology of much existing literature, supporting a. We use a one-dimensional item response theory (IRT) model to estimate constituents' and legislators' ideologies, using the item parameters from the congressional space (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011). (We rely on IRT throughout our studies. We describe in greater detail how we use it to estimate a unidimensional congressional space in the "Data and method" subsection for finding 1 below.) The five constituents we show in the table are the median constituents on this measure, when using survey weights. For interpretability, in table 1 we do not show these scores but instead show the proportion of issues on which each had a liberal view.},

This was assessed by a series of tests that were set up and validated independently of the Governor's counter-proposal. I have studied the Governor's proposed map using the same tests and have determined that it behaves squarely in accordance with the traditional districting principles. On the other hand, the Turzai-Scarnati plan is overwhelmingly likely to have been drawn to increase partisan advantage, since traditional districting principles alone do not explain its partisan skew. I produced over three billion maps similar to the Turzai-Scarnati proposal that are at least as compact, preserve at least as many counties, and keep population deviation to within the 1{\%} threshold, so that a mapmaker can tune them to 1-person deviation while maintaining county preservation and compactness. The fraction of maps that were more Republican-skewed in this sample was less than one in 2 million. This means that even with conservative assumptions, there is less than a 0.1{\%} chance that the Turzai-Scarnati plan would have its partisan skew if its authors had no partisan intent.},

This is because many communities of interest are themselves lopsidedly partisan, and including them whole or undiluted will impede the pathway to achieving an even partisan division in a district's electorate.

The formulated optimization problem is NP-hard. We develop a scalable evolutionary computational approach utilizing massively parallel high performance computing for political redistricting optimization and analysis at fine levels of granularity. Our computational approach is based in strong substantive knowledge and deep adherence to Supreme Court mandates. Since the spatial configuration plays a critical role in the effectiveness and numerical efficiency of redistricting algorithms, we have designed spatial evolutionary algorithm (EA) operators that incorporate spatial characteristics and effectively search the solution space. Our parallelization of the algorithm further harnesses massive parallel computing power provided by supercomputers via the coupling of EA search processes and a highly scalable message passing model that maximizes the overlapping of computing and communication at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate desirable effectiveness and scalability of our approach (up to 131K processors) for solving large redistricting problems, which enables substantive research into the relationship between democratic ideals and phenomena such as partisan gerrymandering.},

We dispute the generalizability of this claim outside the experimental setting. Using NES survey data as well as aggregate sources, we subject their research to rigorous real-world testing. The survey data directly contradict their findings, yielding no evidence of a turnout disadvantage for those who recollected negative presidential campaign advertising.

We find a reduction in white contributions to black Democrats, and to black and Latino Republicans, but little difference in overall fundraising competitiveness. Although we cannot definitively rule out alternative mechanisms that covary with candidate ethnorace, the results suggest that the nomination of minority candidates can increase the ethnoracial representativeness of campaign finance without costs to fundraising.},

The primary end point was the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, new or worsening heart failure, or cardiogenic shock at 30 days. In this post hoc subgroup analysis, we examined the effect of an early invasive strategy on efficacy and safety outcomes after stratification by time from symptom onset to fibrinolysis ({\textless}2 or ≥2 hours). Of 1,059 patients in TRANSFER-AMI, 557 (53{\%}) received fibrinolysis {\textless}2 hours and 502 (47{\%}) ≥2 hours after symptom onset. Compared to patients who received fibrinolysis within 2 hours of symptoms, patients who received fibrinolysis ≥2 hours after symptom onset had higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk scores (median 127 vs 122, p = 0.004). The effect of an early invasive strategy did not differ between symptom-to-fibrinolysis time strata for the primary efficacy end point (p-heterogeneity = 0.67), 30-day mortality, the composite of death or reinfarction at 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year, or bleeding (all p-heterogeneity {\textgreater}0.40).

abstract = {Empirical analysis has lagged behind theoretical advancement in the study of legislative delegation of power to bureaucracies. This article analyzes why state legislatures delegated advisory and policy-forming powers to bureau- cracies for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program from 1935 through 1996. The analysis supports various theories of bureaucratic discretion, while painting a complex political picture of delegation decisions. Legislators rely on bureaucrats to resolve uncertainty, especially when internal legislative information is scarce. Contrary to recent wisdom, however, dele- gation is not found to be associated with the general condition of unified government. Rather, delegation occurs under both divided and unified gov- ernment, but the procedures chosen and appointment powers granted vary under these two conditions},

abstract = {This paper explores on a panel of 19 OECD countries the role of fragmentation in determining fiscal outcomes over the 1970–95 period. We first define the notion of fragmentation of fiscal policy-making as the degree to which the costs of a dollar of aggregate expenditure are internalized by individual decision-makers. Empirically, this notion has two key logical components: the number of decision-makers and the rules of the game, or the budget process. In turn, the number of decision makers can refer to the number of parties in a coalition, or the number of ministers in the cabinet. We test all these determinants against each other, and against perhaps the oldest explanation of all, ideology. We show that cabinet size and, to a lesser degree, coalition size and ideology, are significant and robust determinants of fiscal outcomes. In particular, transfers are the budget items most affected by these factors.},

abstract = {Recently, scholars from law and political science have introduced metrics which use only election outcomes (and not district geometry) to assess the presence of partisan gerrymandering. The most high-profile example of such a tool is the efficiency gap (EG). Some scholars have suggested that such tools should be sensitive enough to alert us when two election outcomes have the same percentage of votes going to political party A, but one of the two awards party A more seats. When a metric is able to distinguish election outcomes in this way, that metric is said to satisfy the efficiency principle. In this article, we show that the efficiency gap fails to satisfy the efficiency principle. We show precisely how the efficiency principle breaks down in the presence of unequal voter turnout. To do this, we first present a construction that, given any rationals 1/4 {\textless} V {\textless} 3/4 and 0 {\textless} S {\textless} 1, constructs an election outcome with vote share V, seat share S, and EG = 0. (For instance, one party can get 26{\%} of the vote and anywhere from 1{\%} to 99{\%} of the seats while the efficiency gap remains zero.) Then, for any election with vote share 1/4 {\textless} V {\textless} 3/4, seat share S, and EG = 0, we express the ratio q of average turnout in districts party A lost to average turnout in districts party A won as a function in only V and S. It is well known that when all districts have equal turnout, EG can be expressed as a simple formula in V and S; we express the efficiency gap of any election as an equation only in V, S, and q. We also report on the values of q that can be observed in actual elections.},

abstract = {Legislative redistricting is a critical element of representative democracy. A number of political scientists have used simulation methods to sample redistricting plans under various constraints in order to assess their impact on partisanship and other aspects of representation. However, while many optimization algorithms have been proposed, surprisingly few simulation methods exist in the literature. Furthermore, the standard algorithm has no theoretical justification, scales poorly, and is unable to incorporate fundamental constraints required by redistricting processes in the real world. To fill this gap, we formulate redistricting as a graph-cut problem and for the first time in the literature propose a new automated redistricting simulator based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed algorithm can incorporate contiguity and equal population constraints at the same time. We apply simulated and parallel tempering to improve the mixing of the resulting Markov chain. Through a small-scale validation study, we show that the proposed algorithm can approximate a target distribution more accurately than the standard algorithm. We also apply the proposed methodology to data from Pennsylvania to demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm to real-world redistricting problems. The open-source software package is available so that researchers and practitioners can implement the proposed methodology. We thank Jowei Chen, Jacob Montgomery, and seminar participants at Chicago Booth, Dartmouth, Duke, Microsoft Research, and SAMSI for useful comments and suggestions. We thank James Lo, Jonathan Olmsted, and Radhika Saksena for their advice on computation. The open-source R package redist for implementing the proposed methodology is available as Fifield et al.

abstract = {Using responses gathered from in-person interviews with 58 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, this study examines the relationship between expressed preferences for social welfare programs and votes for social welfare legislation. We use measures of representatives' attitudes, their voting, and a number of political and dis- trict characteristics to address two questions. First, to what extent are personal policy preferences influenced by political and district factors and to what extent is voting behavior influenced by these same factors? Second and more importantly, what impact do personal policy preferences have on congressional voting decisions? Within these questions, we address the potential differences in the attitude-vote relationship between representatives as a whole and those who are chairs or ranking minority leaders in com- mittees having jurisdiction over social welfare issues. The results show that for members of Congress in general, personal attitudes toward social welfare programs are one of the determining factors in their voting decisions. However, the persuasive power of attitudes for leaders of social-welfare relevant committees is nearly all mediated through the strength of party devotion. Party affiliation is the most important variable explaining the attitudes of committee leaders, but it is far less important than other factors in explaining attitudes of members of Congress at large.},

The trade-off between technical competence and political control is captured in a model of a legislative coalition's decision about agency procedures. The choice variables are the agency's expected preferences and independence.

The behavioral literature in American politics suggests that voters are not informed enough, and are too partisan, to be swing voters, while the institutional literature suggests that moderate candidates tend to perform better. We speak to this debate by examining the link between the ideology of congressional candidates and the turnout of their parties' bases in US House races, 2006–2014. Combining a regression discontinuity design in close primary races with survey and administrative data on individual voter turnout, we find that extremist nominees—as measured by the mix of campaign contributions they receive—suffer electorally, largely because they {\textless}italic{\textgreater}decrease{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} their party's share of turnout in the general election, skewing the electorate towards their opponent's party.

abstract = {This article proposes a decision-theoretic model to explain how cabinets help presidents implement their policy-making strategies. Presidents are assumed to have two policy-making strategies: a strategy based on the use of statutes or a strategy based on executive prerogatives. If the president's preferences and the institutional incentives and economic conditions faced favor a statutory strategy , the president is more likely to appoint a majority cabinet, select more partisan ministers, and distribute portfolios to parties on a proportional basis. Econometric analysis of 106 cabinets appointed in 13 countries of the Ameri-cas demonstrates that the determinants of cabinet legislative status are the size of the president's party, extremist presidents, and economic crises. The share of partisan ministers and proportionality in portfolio allocation are affected by the size of the president's party, extremist presidents holding decree powers, the extension of the president's veto powers, and the elapsing of the president's term.},

I employ an original data set that includes all bills spon- sored during the 109th Congress (2005–2006) and use negative binomial and standard OLS regression techniques to test hypotheses that Latino representatives are more active sponsors of Latino interest bills than non-Latino representatives. Results. Findings demonstrate that both the size of Latino constituencies in congressional districts and descriptive representation significantly and positively predict Latino interest bill sponsorship. Descriptive representation appears partic- ularly influential regarding sponsorship of bills that deal with Latino concerns explicitly. Conclusion. The analysis establishes that descriptive representation enhances the substantive representation of Latinos in bill sponsorship. An impor- tant aspect of this phenomenon is a legislative style on the part of Latino repre- sentatives that more openly, actively, and specifically embraces the interests of Latino constituencies in policy proposals.},

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature - defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all.

We show that this approach is doubly unsatisfactory: although representative democracy cannot be defended as a form of government that prevents some citizens from ruling over others, it can be defended as a special form of epistocracy. We demonstrate that well-designed representative democracies can, through treatment and selection mechanisms, bring forth an especially competent set of individuals to make public policy, even while circumventing the standard objections to epistocratic rule.

By severing the ties between constituents and their incumbents, we argue, redistricting raises information costs, leading to increased levels of nonvoting in U.S. House contests. Survey data from the 1992 American National Election Studies show that redrawn citizens are half as likely to know their incumbent's name as citizens who remain in a familiar incumbent's district and, consequently, significantly more likely to roll off, or abstain from voting in the House election after having cast a presidential vote. We also show that participation rates in the 2002-2006 House elections in Texas-each of which followed a redistricting-match these patterns, with roll-off increasing 3{\%} to 8{\%} in portions of the state that were redrawn, controlling for other factors.

With a novel protocol of beliefs elicitation and structural estimation, we assess the weights voters place upon politicians' valence and ideology , and simulate counterfactual campaigns.

abstract = {Numerous papers by Public Choice oriented scholars and others have sought to test the hypothesis inspired by Downs (1957) that, ceteris paribus, turnout should be higher when elections are close. Most look in cross-sectional terms at variations in turnout at the constituency level for elections of a given type. By and large the results have been disappointing (see, e.g., Foster, 1984). We are skeptical of these weak findings and argue that a complete portrait of the turnout-competition link requires us to examine that link for at least three different types of turnout (turnout among potential eligibles, turnout among registrants, and turnout for a given office relative to other offices such as top of the ticket), and to take into account longitudinal changes in turnout. For recent off-year elections to the U.S. Senate and also for off-year elections to the U.S. House of Representatives in states where there was no gubernatorial or senatorial contest on the ballot, we find strong evidence for higher turnout among eligibles in close contests. For these elections to the U.S. Senate we also find evidence for an ecological effect that leads to turnout being maximized at values of competition other than 50-50. Moreover, when we look at turnout for office relative to top of the ticket voting in the California Assembly and the U.S. Senate in presidential years, we again find some evidence for an ecological effect in which turnout is maximized at a value of Republican vote share above 50 percent and find further strong evidence for a clear link between competition and turnout for office among those at the polls.},

abstract = {American employers are increasingly engaging their workers in the political process. Drawing on original surveys of firms and workers, this paper examines the extent to which employers act as political machines, channeling their employees into politics in ways intended to support corporate interests. I show that employer political requests greatly increased the likelihood that employees would report participating in politics around the 2014 election and employer requests were roughly as effective as those from unions and political parties. I also find that employer mobilization was most effective when employers used warnings of job loss to motivate participation and when employers could monitor the behavior of their employees, suggesting that employers are indeed acting as a type of political machine. My results shed light on the ways that American firms recruit workers into politics and show that employer mobilization of workers may be an important source of political power for business. as an important location of political activity for many work-ers. Discussions with coworkers, for instance, can be a useful source of political information and encouragement to par-ticipate in politics (Abrams, Iversen, and Soskice 2010; Est-lund 2003; Mondak and Mutz 2001; Mutz and Mondak 2006). Workplaces are also a site for the political mobiliza-tion of workers by labor unions (Flavin and Hartney 2015; Leighley and Nagler 2007). In this paper, I report on an-other, largely neglected, type of political interaction in the American workplace, that between the top managers and supervisors at a company and rank-and-file workers. Using original national surveys of workers and firms, I show that this interaction—what I term employer mobiliza-tion—is a source of political recruitment for many American workers. From 2014 to 2015, roughly similar proportions of workers reported contact from labor unions and employers (about 7{\%} and 5{\%}, respectively). I estimate, moreover, that employer mobilization was just as likely to increase self-reported political activity as mobilization by labor unions and political parties. Finally, I examine the conditions under which employer recruitment is most effective, and I find that employers' ability to monitor employee political activities and beliefs plays a significant role in moderating employer mobiliza-tion efforts. Employees were much more likely to report responding to employer political requests when employees perceived that their managers could monitor their political beliefs and actions. Employers, in turn, were more likely to mobilize their workers when they had greater capacity to monitor employees' political choices. Conditional on mo-bilizing their workers in politics, managers were also more likely to indicate that mobilization was a more successful political strategy for advancing corporate interests when managers were monitoring their workers' activities—espe-cially voting—more closely. Given the importance of monitoring for employer mo-bilization, I suggest that a broad cross section of American companies might be viewed as a type of political machine, using the relationship managers possess with their work-force to encourage employees to participate in politics in ways that benefit the firm. By recruiting their workers into politics, firms can help to elect candidates who will main-tain a favorable policy environment for the company, and firms also have the means of monitoring and threatening to},

abstract = {The ever-growing literature on human capital has long recognized that the scope of the theory extends well beyond the traditional analysis of schooling and on-the-job training. Migration, maintenance of health, crime and punishment, even marriage and suicide, are all decisions which can usefully be considered from the human capital point of view. Yet economists have ignored the analysis of an important class of activities which can and should be brought within the purview of the theory. A prime example of this class is brushing teeth.' The conventional analysis of toothbrushing has centered around two basic models. The "bad taste in one's mouth" model is based on the notion that each person has a "taste for brushing," and the fact that brushing frequencies differ is "explained" by differences in tastes. Since any pat-tern of human behavior can be rationalized by such implicit theorizing, this model is devoid of empirically testable predictions, and hence uninteresting. The "mother told me so" theory is based on differences in cultural upbringing. Here it is argued, for example, that thrice-a-day brushers brush three times daily because their mothers forced them to do so as children. Of course, this is hardly a complete explanation. Like most psychological theories, it leaves open the question of why mothers should want their children to brush after every meal. But it does at least have one testable implication: that individuals from higher social classes will brush more frequently. In these pages I describe a new model which is firmly grounded in economic theory and which generates a large number of empirically testable hypotheses. I then show that the predictions of the model are supported by the data. EDITOR'S NOTE.-This paper derives from the Princeton oral tradition. I wish to thank my dentist for filling in some important gaps in the analysis, and my colleague, Michael Rothschild, for insightful kibitzing. Support for this research is graciously solicited. 1 The analysis to follow can also be applied to such important problems as combing hair, washing hands, and cutting fingernails, as I hope to show in a series of future papers. 887},

While scholars typically treat violent protests as deliberate acts undertaken in pursuit of specific goals, due to a lack of appropriate data and difficulty in causal identification, there is scant evidence of whether riots can actually increase support for these goals. Using geocoded data, we analyze measures of policy support before and after the 1992 Los Angeles riot - one of the most high-profile events of political violence in recent American history - that occurred just prior to an election. Contrary to some expectations from the academic literature and the popular press, we find that the riot caused a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls. Investigating the sources of this shift, we find that it was likely the result of increased mobilization of both African American and white voters. Remarkably, this mobilization endures over a decade later.},

On the other hand, computers have been accused of enabling redistricting authorities to effortlessly achieve any nefarious goals. The reality is more complex.},

abstract = {Researchers who generate data often optimize efficiency and robustness by choosing stratified over simple random sampling designs. Yet, all theories of inference proposed to justify matching methods are based on simple random sampling. This is all the more troubling because, although these theories require exact matching, most matching applications resort to some form of ex post stratification (on a propensity score, distance metric, or the covariates) to find approximate matches, thus nullifying the statistical properties the theories are designed to ensure. Fortunately, the type of sampling used in a theory of inference is an axiom, rather than an assumption vulnerable to being proven wrong, and so we can replace simple with stratified sampling, so long as we can show, as we do here, that the implications of the theory are coherent and remain true. We also show, under our resulting stratified sampling-based theory of inference, that matching in observational studies becomes intuitive and easy to understand. Properties of estimators based on this theory can be satisfied without asymptotics, assumptions hidden in data analysis rather than stated up front, or unfamiliar estimators. This theory also allows binary, multicategory, and continuous treatment variables from the outset and straightforward extensions for imperfect treatment assignment and different versions of treatments.},

Moreover, primaries tend to benefit the party whose median voter is closer to the overall median. The bad news is that the winner of the general election need not be the candidate with the highest overall quality since primaries that are too competitive can prove harmful.

For a panel of the 26 Swiss cantons over the 1980–1998 periods, this paper explores the role of fragmented governments on fiscal policy outcomes. We distinguish between two variants of fragmented governments: cabinet size and coalition size. In addition, we analyze whether constitutional rules for executive and legislature as well as formal fiscal restraints shape the size of government and how different rules interact with fragmentation. The results indicate that the number of ministers in the cabinet is positively associated with the size of government. While fiscal referendums effectively restrict the size of government, there is also evidence that fiscal referendums relax the fiscal commons problem to some extent.},

Concomitantly, legislative procedures such as the filibuster and executive veto often impede the ability of the legislature to pass policies. We explore the tension between these two forces by incorporating legislative procedures and initiative proposal into a spatial model of the policymaking process. We find that the ability to propose initiatives sometimes breaks legislative gridlock, but that other times pivotal players may prefer the initiative outcome and therefore prevent the legislature from preempting a ballot measure. In particular, we show that initiative use increases with the distance between pivotal actors and the median voter. An empirical analysis of initiative use in the American states provides support for this prediction.},

Winning candidates share preferences for institutions that are independent of whether they are affiliated with a governing or opposition party. This self-interest effect is attenuated by ideology and attitudes about democracy. Pure self-interest, then, is an incomplete explanation for politicians' attitudes towards electoral institutions.

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Scholarly research has demonstrated rather conclusively that American political elites have undergone a marked partisan polarization over the past thirty years. There is less agreement, however, as to whether the American electorate is polarized. This review article evaluates the evidence, causes and consequences of polarization on both the elite and mass levels. A marked difference between the two is found. Elites are polarized by almost any definition, although this state of affairs is quite common historically. In contrast, mass attitudes are now better sorted by party, but generally not polarized. While it is unclear whether this potentially troubling disconnect between centrist mass attitudes and extreme elite preferences has negative policy consequences, it appears that the super-majoritarian nature of the US Senate serves as a bulwark against policy outcomes that are more ideologically extreme than the public would prefer. Moreover, a public more centrist than those who represent it has also at times exerted a moderating influence on recent policies.},

abstract = {Each of four theoretical traditions in the study of American politics – which can be characterized as theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic Elite Domination, and two types of interest group pluralism, Majoritarian Pluralism and Biased Pluralism – offers different predictions about which sets of actors have how much influence over public policy: average citizens; economic elites; and organized interest groups, mass-based or business-oriented. A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. This paper reports on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues. Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.},

This paper attempts to answer that question by examining how government systems influence macroeconomic performance.

Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is sizable. For example, annual output growth is between 0.6 and 1.2 percentage points lower and inflation is estimated to be at least four percentage points higher under presidential regimes relative to those under parliamentary ones. The difference in distribu-tional outcomes is even starker; income inequality is 12 to 24{\%} worse under presidential systems.},

Democratic presidential candidates will find it increasingly difficult to win elections without having some success in the South and Southwest as Barack Obama did in 2008 but many previous candidates failed to do. While migration will also benefit some solid Democratic states such as California, on balance Republican presidential candidates are poised to benefit from the status of Sun Belt states as magnets for both foreign immigration and domestic migration from a retirement cohort of unprecedented size.},

Departing from the business power scholarship that emphasizes structural, electoral, or financial mechanisms for corporate influence, I argue that lawmakers are likely to rely on businesses' proposals when they lack the time and resources to develop legislation on their own, especially when they also hold an ideological affinity for business. Using two new datasets of “model bills” developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a policy group that promotes pro-business legislation across the states, I find strong support for this theory. These results indicate that ALEC provides private policy capacity to state legislators who would otherwise lack such support, and relatedly, that low state policy capacity may favor certain organized interests over others—namely the business interests affiliated with ALEC. My findings have implications for the study of business influence in policymaking, as well as for state politics.},

abstract = {Numerous papers by Public Choice oriented scholars and others have sought to test the hypothesis inspired by Downs (1957) that, ceteris paribus, turnout should be higher when elections are close. Most look in cross-sectional terms at variations in turnout at the constituency level for elections of a given type. By and large the results have been disappointing (see, e.g., Foster, 1984). We are skeptical of these weak findings and argue that a complete portrait of the turnout-competition link requires us to examine that link for at least three different types of turnout (turnout among potential eligibles, turnout among registrants, and turnout for a given office relative to other offices such as top of the ticket), and to take into account longitudinal changes in turnout. For recent off-year elections to the U.S. Senate and also for off-year elections to the U.S. House of Representatives in states where there was no gubernatorial or senatorial contest on the ballot, we find strong evidence for higher turnout among eligibles in close contests. For these elections to the U.S. Senate we also find evidence for an ecological effect that leads to turnout being maximized at values of competition other than 50-50. Moreover, when we look at turnout for office relative to top of the ticket voting in the California Assembly and the U.S. Senate in presidential years, we again find some evidence for an ecological effect in which turnout is maximized at a value of Republican vote share above 50 percent and find further strong evidence for a clear link between competition and turnout for office among those at the polls.},

abstract = {The usual legal story about partisan gerrymandering is relentlessly pessimis- tic. The courts did not even recognize the cause of action until the 1980s ; they have never struck down a district plan on this basis ; and four sitting justices want to vacate the field altogether. The Supreme Court's most recent gerrymandering deci- sion, however, is the most encouraging development in this area in a generation. Several justices expressed interest in the concept of partisan symmetry - the idea that a plan should treat the major parties symmetrically in terms of the conversion of votes to seats - and suggested that it could be shaped into a legal test. In this Article , we take the justices at their word. First, we introduce a new measure of partisan symmetry: the efficiency gap. It represents the difference be- tween the parties' respective wasted votes in an election, divided by the total num- ber of votes cast. It captures, in a single tidy number, all of the packing and crack- ing decisions that go into a district plan. It also is superior to the metric of gerrymandering, partisan bias, that litigants and scholars have used until now. Partisan bias can be calculated only by shifting votes to simulate a hypothetical tied election. The efficiency gap eliminates the need for such counterfactual analysis. Second, we compute the efficiency gap for congressional and state house plans between 1972 and 2012. Over this period as a whole, the typical plan was fairly balanced and neither party enjoyed a systematic advantage. But in recent years - and peaking in the 2012 election - plans have exhibited steadily larger and more pro-Republican gaps. In fact, the plans in effect today are the most extreme gerrymanders in modern history. And what is more, several are likely to remain extreme for the remainder of the decade, as indicated by our sensitivity testing. Finally, we explain how the efficiency gap could be converted into doctrine. We propose setting thresholds above which plans would be presumptively unconsti- tutional : two seats for congressional plans and 8 percent for state house plans, but only if the plans probably will stay unbalanced for the remainder of the cycle. Plans with gaps above these thresholds would be unlawful unless states could show that the gaps either resulted from the consistent application of legitimate pol- icies or were inevitable due to the states' political geography. This approach would neatly slice the Gordian knot the Court has tied for itself, explicitly replying to the Court's "unanswerable question" of "[h]ow much political . .},

abstract = {Clinicians commonly measure the 13CO2 in exhaled breath samples following administration of a metabolic tracer (breath testing) to diagnose certain infections and metabolic disorders. We believe that breath testing can become a powerful tool to investigate novel questions about the influence of ecological and physiological factors on the oxidative fates of exogenous nutrients. Here we examined several predictions regarding the oxidative kinetics of specific carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids in a dietary generalist, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). After administering postprandial birds with 20 mg of one of seven 13C-labeled tracers, we measured rates of 13CO2 production every 15 min over 2 h. We found that sparrows oxidized exogenous amino acids far more rapidly than carbohydrates or fatty acids, and that different tracers belonging to the same class of physiological fuels had unique oxidative kinetics. Glycine had a mean maximum rate of oxidation (2021 nmol min−1) that was significantly higher than that of leucine (351 nmol min−1), supporting our prediction that nonessential amino acids are oxidized more rapidly than essential amino acids. Exogenous glucose and fructose were oxidized to a similar extent (5.9{\%} of dose), but the time required to reach maximum rates of oxidation was longer for fructose. The maximum rates of oxidation were significantly higher when exogenous glucose was administered as an aqueous solution (122 nmol min−1), rather than as an oil suspension (93 nmol min−1), supporting our prediction that exogenous lipids negatively influence rates of exogenous glucose oxidation. Dietary fatty acids had the lowest maximum rates of oxidation (2-6 nmol min−1), and differed significantly in the extent to which each was oxidized, with 0.73{\%}, 0.63{\%} and 0.21{\%} of palmitic, oleic and stearic acid tracers oxidized, respectively.},

Public commentary commonly uses terms such as ``reversal of winners,'' ``wrong winner,'' ``divided verdict,'' and ``misfire'' to describe this phenomenon; the academic social choice literature adds such terms as ``repre- sentative inconsistency,'' ``compound majority paradox,'' ``referendum paradox,'' and ``majority deficit.'' Election inversions can occur under any two-tier electoral system, including the U.S. Electoral College. As is well known, the Electoral College actually produced a ``wrong winner'' in the 2000 Presidential election, and it has done so twice before.},

Yet, while Trump's nomination was hard to predict, it is not difficult to explain. We show that Trump's campaign message succeeded by activating longstanding, but often unappreciated, sentiments among Republican voters about immigration and economic entitlements. In particular, his support was concentrated among Republican voters with hawkish views on immigration and relatively liberal views on economic policy. Moreover, these views preceded support for Trump, rather than the other way around. Drawing on an original panel survey, we show that attitudes about immigration and economic entitlements measured in 2011 strongly predicted support for Trump in 2016. Although Trump's coalition struck many observers as odd, it was predicated on a set of attitudes that is not unusual among Republican voters. He simply hunted where the ducks are.},

Variation over time in the relative intensity of the opposing communications, along with citizen differences in attention to politics and in political values, interact in the model to explain both cross-sectional patterns of mass opinion and opinion change across surveys.

It seeks to explain how human practices and institutions emerge as unintended consequences of myriad individual actions, and points to the limits of rationalism and conscious design in social life. The political implications of spontaneous order theory explain both the enthusiasm and the skepticism it has elicited, but its basic mechanisms remain elusive and underexamined. This article teases out the internal logic of the concept, arguing that it can be taken to mean several different things. Some are forward-looking (defining it in terms of present-day functioning), whereas others are backward-looking (defining it in terms of historical origins). Yet none of these possibilities prove fully coherent or satisfactory, suggesting that spontaneous order cannot bear the analytical weight that has been placed on it.},

We find that turnover rates, overall, continued to decline through the 1980s but that the long downward trend abated in the 1990s as a result of term limits. The effects of term limits vary depending on the length of the term limit and the opportunity structure in the state. There is also a strong relationship between the presence of term limits and interchamber movement. In addition to term limits, professionalization levels, redistricting, the presence of multi-member districts, and partisan swings explain differences in turnover rates between states.},

Furthermore, the analysis finds that task significance, variety and autonomy have similar effects on the level of job satisfaction among both employees and self-employed individuals, while feedback has a weaker effect when the individual is self-employed and task identity does not affect job satisfaction in either group. Overall, the study points to the need to develop jobs that are high in autonomy, variety and task significance for professionals in order to enhance job satisfaction.},

I provide evidence for this argument using election data from 25 large cities and demographic data matched to city finances in more than 2,600 places.

A large body of work assumes that individuals do in fact make rational economic, political, and social decisions. Yet hundreds of experiments suggest that this is not the case. Framing effects constitute one of the most stunning and influential demonstrations of irrationality. The effects not only challenge the foundational assumptions of much of the social sciences (e.g., the existence of coherent preferences or stable attitudes), but also lead many scholars to adopt alternative approaches (e.g., prospect theory). Surprisingly, virtually no work has sought to specify the political conditions under which framing effects occur. I fill this gap by offering a theory and experimental test. I show how contextual forces (e.g., elite competition, deliberation) and individual attributes (e.g., expertise) affect the success of framing. The results provide insight into when rationality assumptions apply and, also, have broad implications for political psychology and experimental methods.},

While scholars typically treat violent protests as deliberate acts undertaken in pursuit of specific goals, due to a lack of appropriate data and difficulty in causal identification, there is scant evidence of whether riots can actually increase support for these goals. Using geocoded data, we analyze measures of policy support before and after the 1992 Los Angeles riot - one of the most high-profile events of political violence in recent American history - that occurred just prior to an election. Contrary to some expectations from the academic literature and the popular press, we find that the riot caused a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls.

abstract = {BARD is the first (and at time of writing, only) open source software package for general redistricting and redistricting analysis. BARD provides methods to create, display, compare, edit, automatically refine, evaluate, and profile political districting plans. BARD aims to provide a framework for scientific analysis of redistricting plans and to facilitate wider public participation in the creation of new plans. BARD facilitates map creation and refinement through command-line, graphical user interface, and automatic methods. Since redistricting is a computationally complex partitioning problem not amenable to an exact optimization solution, BARD implements a variety of selectable metaheuristics that can be used to refine existing or randomly- generated redistricting plans based on user-determined criteria. Furthermore, BARD supports automated generation of redistricting plans and profiling of plans by assigning different weights to various criteria, such as district compactness or equality of population. This functionality permits exploration of trade-o s among criteria. The intent of a redistricting authority may be explored by examining these trade-o s and inferring which reasonably observable plans were not adopted. Redistricting is a computationally-intensive problem for even modest-sized states. Performance is thus an important consideration in BARD's design and implementation. The program implements performance enhancements such as evaluation caching, explicit memory management, and distributed computing across snow clusters.},

abstract = {Since 1972, campaign spending by House incumbents has skyrocketed, particularly in those districts with marginal support for the incumbent's party. At the same time, parties in the House have become much more cohesive in the way they vote, producing more precise and informative party brands. We argue that these two phenomena are fundamentally linked. As parties have developed more precise reputations, incumbents in these districts must spend much more to attract voters in “marginal” districts, who would be willing to vote for a candidate with the particular incumbent's legislative record, but not the average member of his party. Increasingly precise party reputations provide voters with stronger priors that incumbents are just like the rest of their party, and incumbents in marginal districts must spend more to overcome these beliefs. We demonstrate this using a simple formal model and test it empirically using campaign-spending data from 1972 to 2008.},

These include variants of the simple bias that considers only deviation of seats from 50{\%} at statewide 50{\%} vote. Also included are equalization of losing votes and equalization of wasted votes, both of which apply directly when the statewide vote is not 50{\%} and which require, not just partisan symmetry, but specific forms of the seats-votes curve. A new measure of bias is introduced, based on the geometric area between the seats-vote curve and the symmetrically inverted seats-votes curve. These measures are applied to recent Pennsylvania congressional elections and to abstract models of the seats-votes curves. The numerical values obtained from the various measures of bias are compared and contrasted. Each bias measure has merits for different seats-votes curves and for different elections, but all essentially agree for most cases when applied to measure only partisan bias, not conflated with competitiveness. This supports the inclusion of partisan fairness as a fundamental element for election law reform, and some options are discussed.},

Unfortunately, this common approach may lead to biased estimates. In this article, we show that the bias can be avoided by focusing on a quantity of interest called the controlled direct effect. Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations—an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Two examples—one on ethnic fractionalization's effect on civil war and one on the impact of historical plough use on contemporary female political participation—illustrate the framework and methodology.},

Yet credible evidence of whether these programs can shift support for governments and insurgents remains scarce. We experimentally evaluate a program of livelihood training and one-time unconditional cash transfers on combatant support among 2,597 at-risk youths in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Employing survey methodologies for sensitive questions, we find that training alone has little effect on combatant support. Cash has a boom-and-bust dynamic, initially increasing pro-government sentiment before reversing itself months later, leading to higher Taliban support. When combined with livelihood training, cash increased support for the Afghan government in the medium term. We interpret these results as consistent with a credit capture argument. While each intervention alone was a weak signal of government competency, the combination of training and cash provided participants with sufficient information to revise their beliefs about government performance and responsiveness. },

Larger parties thus internalize more costs than small parties because they represent more groups. This argument implies that the public sector should be larger the more parties there are in the government coalition. We test this prediction using yearly time-series cross-sectional data from 1970 to 1998 in 17 European countries. We find that increasing the number of parties in government increases the fraction of GDP accounted for by government spending by close to half a percentage point, or more than one billion current dollars in the typical year. We find little support for the alternative claim that the number of legislative parties affects the size of the public sector, except via the number of parties in government. {\textcopyright} 2006, Midwest Political Science Association.},

Results from regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference designs suggest that the presence of ethnoracial minority candidates increases the share of minority contributions in US House elections. We find a reduction in white contributions to black Democrats, and to black and Latino Republicans, but little difference in overall fundraising competitiveness. Although we cannot definitively rule out alternative mechanisms that covary with candidate ethnorace, the results suggest that the nomination of minority candidates can increase the ethnoracial representativeness of campaign finance without costs to fundraising.},

Though macropartisanship, typically seen as a biennial time series, appears essentially constant, our quarterly treatment demonstrates substantial and notably systematic movement of this crucial barometer of the U.S. party system. We demonstrate that it varies systematically with respect to time, has electoral consequences, and can be modeled as a function of economic evaluations and approval of the incumbent presidential administration. Macropartisanship, we argue, is a variable like others, subject to routine ebb and flow as citizens in the aggregate reflect their experiences of politics onto the parties. Its medium-term movements of considerable magnitude are lasting enough to matter but occur without connoting shifts in the underlying party system and can be understood without invoking the crises and convulsions of realignment theory.},

Their contribution is to offer combinatorics insights into the implications of such asymmetries in the form of three new indicators: Winningness, Vulnerability, and Fragility. They then explore the magnitude and effects of these three measures for the presidential elections of 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012. The major contribution of this note is to extend their analyses of these measures to an additional 34 elections: every election in the modern two-party post-Civil War era from 1868 to 2016. We find the Winningness measure to predict very well over the entire set of 38 presidential elections. Inspired by their work, we also offer a new and simpler metric for partisan asymmetries in noncompetitive states and show how it can predict the expected closeness of EC outcomes as well or better than the more complex combinatorics measures they propose.},

abstract = {Studies of the political determinants of economic inequality have usually focused on the national government, but in federalist systems subnational governments may also be important. In recent decades, the U.S. national government has been less active in fighting inequality, but increasing devolution means that states wanting to address this problem have had a greater incentive and perhaps means by which to do so. Applying power resources theory, we argue that in states where left parties are stronger and more liberal politics are enacted, the government will reduce inequality and that this state effect becomes more pronounced as middle- and lower-class power wanes nationally. In the analysis we find that both federal and state governments influence inequality, and since the Republican takeover of Congress in 1995, the states have played a more important role in shaping the income distribution.

abstract = {We build a generational model of presidential voting, in which long-term partisan presi- dential voting preferences are formed, in large part, through a weighted “running tally” of retrospective presidential evaluations, where weights are determined by the age in which the evaluation was made. Under the model, the Gallup Presidential Approval Rating time series is shown to be a good approximation to the political events that inform retrospec- tive presidential evaluations. The political events of a voter's teenage and early adult years, centered around the age of 18, are enormously important in the formation of these long- term partisan preferences. The model is shown to be powerful, explaining a substantial amount of the macro-level voting trends of the last half century, especially for white voters and non-Southern whites in particular. We use a narrative of presidential political events from the 1940s to the present day to describe the model, illustrating the formation of five main generations of presidential voters.},

abstract = {Objectives. To generate, via application of Bayes Theorem, accurate estimates about the size of Hispanic populations in California cities from very limited data on the surnames of those living in the cities. Methods. We make use here of the ratio of those with the name "GARCIA" to those with the name "ANDERSON" in those cities, one of which is far more likely to be Hispanic and one of which is far more likely to be non-Hispanic. Results. For four cities that vary dramatically in their Hispanic populations, using only two common names we are able to estimate the Hispanic population in the cities. Conclusions. We lay the background for our surprising results by underscoring common fallacies in using surnames for purposes of ethnic identification, such as the belief that the proportion of bearers of a given name who are Hispanic can be specified as a unique percentage. We show that how "Hispanic" any given name will turn out to be is a function of the overall demography of the subpopulation being analyzed, which will also affect the distribution of names within that subpopulation. There are a number of situations where we do not have reliable information about a group's proportion of a given population, but wish to estimate that proportion. Let us assume that surnames held by members of the group, say Hispanics, 1 are relatively distinctive. Let us further imagine that we have the names of those in the population whose group composition we wish to estimate, for example, hospital patients, or registered voters, or purchasers of some particular commodity. In principle, by matching surname with estimated ethnicity, we may derive estimates of group population shares in the given list of names. The main theoretical result in this article is the exposition of a methodology that uses very limited data on surnames-indeed, data from only two surnames, "ANDERSON"},

abstract = {There has been a recent surge in work on measuring partisan bias in single-member (SMD) redistricting plans. A classic SMD gerrymander is "efficient": It "cracks" a party's supporters so they barely lose many seats and "packs" the remainder in a few seats that the party wins by large margins. This essay classifies these new metrics and proposes a simple principle for evaluating each metric as a gauge of this efficiency. It finds that only methods that measure the packing and cracking directly through the counting of wasted votes can serve as consistent measures of the concept. Indeed, measures of symmetry in the seats-votes curve not only fail to consistently measure efficiency but suffer from internal contradictions in certain circumstances. Further examination of the wasted votes measures reveals that only a modified version of the "efficiency gap" - a measure active in ongoing litigation - can serve as a measure of efficiency under a wide range of electoral circumstances. Among the rest, there is considerable variation in their ability to serve as appropriate measures of the concept.},

@article{Garand1991b,
abstract = {In this paper we extend the research program on the seats-votes relationship to the U.S. elec-toral college. Borrowing liberally from the work of King and Browning (1987), we develop measures of representational form and partisan bias in the relationship between popular vote proportions and electoral vote proportions for each presidential election from 1872 to 1988. Two major findings emerge from our analysis: (1) the electoral college is dominated by a majoritarian representational form, with popular vote winners usually capturing a substantially higher proportion of the electoral vote than would be suggested by their popular vote proportion; and (2) contrary to the conventional wisdom of a Republican bias, the electoral college has a Democratic partisan bias for most of the years under study, particularly in the years since the end of World War II. Over the years numerous scholars, journalists, and political observers have expressed reservations about the indirect form of presidential selection encom-passed in the U.S. electoral college. Critics have complained that the electoral college allows for substantial incongruence between the proportion of popular votes cast for each presidential candidate and the proportion of electoral votes earned. For instance, in the 1988 presidential election, George Bush received 54{\%} of the popular vote but 79{\%} of the electoral vote, while in 1984 an even more pronounced disparity occurred when Ronald Reagan received 59{\%} of the popular vote and 98{\%} of the electoral vote. Of substantial concern to those ad-vocating a "fairer" electoral system is the possibility that the popular vote win-ner will lose in the electoral college-a phenomenon that has not occurred in this century but did occur in the 1824, 1876, and 1888 presidential elections. More generally, the question of the representational nature of electoral sys-tems in democratic societies has long fascinated students of politics. One major issue that has dominated the literature on democratic electoral systems pertains to how votes cast by citizens in elections are translated into different configura-tions of seats in representative bodies, with the implicit assumption being that these configurations often depend on the "rules of the game" (i.e., the structure of the electoral system in place).

Existing approaches to automated redistricting may introduce bias and encounter difficulties when drawing districts of large and even medium-sized jurisdictions. We present a new algorithm that can neutrally generate legislative districts without indications of bias that are contiguous, balanced and relatively compact. The algorithm does not show the kinds of bias found in prior algorithms and is an advance over previously published algorithms for redistricting because it is computationally more efficient. We use the new algorithm to draw 10,000 maps of congressional districts in Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas. We find that it is unlikely that the number of majority-minority districts we observe in the Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas congressional maps of these states would happen through a neutral redistricting process.},

The many instances of politicians exploiting the redistricting process to achieve a partisan goal have been widely chronicled. Nonpartisan redistricting plans serve to keep politicians from taking advantage of the process for their own advantage, and they therefore ostensibly serve to increase competition, which in turn improves representation. However, the effect of nonpartisan plans on elections is not entirely clear. I seek to adjudicate competing conclusions about the effect of nonpartisan plans by evaluating the effect of different redistricting methods on quality candidate emergence.

Second, theories of racial priming have not adequately accounted for both an increasingly racialized political climate and increased tolerance for explicit anti‐minority appeals. In two survey experiments fielded both before Trump's rise and after his presidential victory, we find the Implicit‐Explicit (IE) model always fails for anti‐black appeals, sometimes fails for anti‐immigrant appeals, but consistently holds for anti‐Latino appeals. While we find the null effects of implicit versus explicit anti‐black and anti‐immigrant appeals are partly driven by tolerance for the explicit appeals, we also find evidence that white Americans are adept at recognizing the racial content of appeals featuring widely used, congruent issue‐group pairs. Our findings shed light on conditions under which the IE model does and does not hold in the current political era.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Objective The objective of this article is to analyze the reasoning underpinning the Supreme Court's rejection of the efficiency gap in Gill v. Whitford as a useful measure of partisan fairness in redistricting. Methods I undertake this analysis by reviewing prior judicial commentary on measures of partisan fairness and debates among political science professionals concerning how and whether to use aggregate statewide seat and vote totals to assess whether there is bias across legislative district elections. Results The analysis reveals that the Supreme Court's rejection of the efficiency gap and other statewide measures of partisan fairness is based upon thoughtful skepticism of the extent to which votes cast under different conditions in different legislative districts for choices among discrete slates of candidates can be aggregated meaningfully into statewide measures that ignore these district-specific conditions. This skepticism is reinforced by debates among scholars about how and whether partisan votes can be aggregated in this manner. Conclusion The Court's rejection of the efficiency gap and skepticism about other aggregate measures of partisan fairness in redistricting reinforces the extensive criticism of using the single-member district electoral system. It distorts electoral outcomes, limits voter choice, and, thereby, renders comparisons of partisan votes in different districts quite questionable. A shift to multimember districts with some form of proportional representation such as ranked choice voting would resolve much of the criticism of and uncertainty in redistricting analysis based on the statewide aggregation of discrete legislative district election results.},

Here we present lazy splaying, a new search tree algorithm that moves frequently accessed items close to the root without making the root a bottleneck. Lazy splaying is fast and highly scalable making at most one local adjustment to the tree on each access. It can be combined with other sequential or concurrent search tree algorithms. In the experimental evaluation we integrated lazy splaying into Bronson et. al.'s optimistic search tree implementation to get a concurrent highly scalable search tree, and show that it significantly improves performance on realistic non-uniform access patterns, while only slightly degrading performance for uniform accesses.},

abstract = {Much recent theorizing about the utility of voting concludes that voting is an irrational act in that it usually costs more to vote than one can expect to get in return. This conclusion is doubtless disconcerting ideologically to democrats; but ideological embarrassment is not our interest here. Rather we are concerned with an apparent paradox in the theory. The writers who constructed these analyses were engaged in an endeavor to explain political behavior with a calculus of rational choice; yet they were led by their argument to the conclusion that voting, the fundamental political act, is typically irrational. We find this conflict between purpose and conclusion bizarre but not nearly so bizarre as a non-explanatory theory: The function of theory is to explain behavior and it is certainly no explanation to assign a sizeable part of politics to the mysterious and inexplicable world of the irrational. This essay is, therefore, an effort to reinterpret the voting calculus so that it can fit comfortably into a rationalistic theory of political behavior. We describe a calculus of voting from which one infers that it is reasonable for those who vote to do so and also that it is equally reasonable for those who do not vote not to do so. Furthermore we present empirical evidence that citizens actually behave as if they employed this calculus.},

abstract = {Abstract Scholars have long argued that international organizations solve information problems through increased transparency. This article introduces a distinct problem that instead requires such institutions to keep information secret. We argue that states often seek to reveal intelligence about other states' violations of international rules and laws but are deterred by concerns about revealing the sources and methods used to collect it. Properly equipped international organizations, however, can mitigate these dilemmas by analyzing and acting on sensitive information while protecting it from wide dissemination. Using new data on intelligence disclosures to the International Atomic Energy Agency and an analysis of the full universe of nuclear proliferation cases, we demonstrate that strengthening the agency's intelligence protection capabilities led to greater intelligence sharing and fewer suspected nuclear facilities. However, our theory suggests that this solution gives informed states a subtle form of influence and is in tension with the normative goal of international transparency.},

abstract = {Abstract Gerrymandering has long characterised the electoral cartography of the United States and a sequence of cases seeking to outlaw the practice have all failed before the Supreme Court. Its judgement in a 2006 case indicated that although the Court recognised the practice, it could identify no formal means of evaluating whether any particular map of Congressional or State electoral districts was a gerrymander that violated a constitutional provision. This encouraged those who drew up new district maps in many states after publication of the 2010 census data, most of which favoured the Republican party and were more egregious than previous such cartographies. A minority judgement in that case did suggest ways in which a gerrymander could be proved, however, and these were followed in a case brought regarding new State Assembly districts for Wisconsin. A lower court found in favour of the plaintiffs but this was over-turned by a unanimous Supreme Court which found that the plaintiffs had no standing to challenge a state-wide map. A concurrent decision by a minority of the Justices did suggest ways in which standing could be established and gerrymanders countered, and this may stimulate further cases?although it is uncertain whether a majority on the Court will accept such arguments. Meanwhile, America gerrymanders on.},

This is unfortunate as our understanding of how Congress performs and has evolved over time is directly linked to how its elected representatives reach and maintain office. In an effort to better understand early U.S. House elections, we revisit the era of the "partisan press" where newspapers were the main source of news for American voters and were typically operated by one of the two major parties. Using a data set linking the geographic location of partisan newspapers with electoral data during the early 19th century, we examine district-specific factors impacting the competitiveness of House races. We uncover previously unidentified evidence of candidate-specific effects during this historical era along with confirmation of media influence in the context of early American elections. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {In League of Women Voters v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (2018) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down as a “severe and durable” partisan gerrymander the congressional map drawn by Republicans in 2011 and used in elections from 2012-2016. It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. After Pennsylvania failed to enact a lawful remedy plan of its own (due to total disagreement as to how to proceed between the newly elected Democratic governor and the still Republican-controlled legislature), the Court then ordered into place for the 2018 election a map of its own drawn for it by a court-appointed consultant. In a split court, the Court map was endorsed only by judges with Democratic affiliations. Here we compare the 2011 and 2018 congressional maps in terms of a variety of proposed metrics for detecting partisan gerrymandering. We also examine the remedy map proposed by a group of Republican legislators and that proposed by the Democratic governor. We conclude that the 2011 map was a blatant and undisguised pro-Republican gerrymander. Moreover, the remedy map proposed by Republican legislators was a covert pro-Republican gerrymander (what we refer to as a “stealth gerrymander”). The Democratic governor's proposed plan cannot be classified as a pro-Democratic gerrymander and indeed has, if anything, a slight pro-Republican tilt. The 2018 court-drawn remedial map, by all measures, was not a gerrymander.},

It argues that the degree to which the coalition formation process is characterised by uncertainty and complexity influences portfolio allocation. In uncertain and complex bargaining situations, par- ties that otherwise would be in an advantageous bargaining position will have a dif- ficult time exploiting their bargaining advantage. As a result, portfolio allocation in such circumstances will be closer to proportionality.

Yet, these community-level drivers are notoriously difficult to study because public opinion surveys provide biased measures of both prejudice and radicalization. We examine the relationship between anti-Muslim and pro-ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) Internet searches in 3099 U.S. counties between 2014 and 2016 using instrumental variable models that control for various community-level factors associated with radicalization. We find that anti-Muslim searches are strongly associated with pro-ISIS searches—particularly in communities with high levels of poverty and ethnic homogeneity. Although more research is needed to verify the causal nature of this relationship, this finding suggests that minority groups may be more susceptible to radicalization if they experience discrimination in settings where they are isolated and therefore highly visible—or in communities where they compete with majority groups for limited financial resources. We evaluate the validity of our findings using several other data sources and discuss the implications of our findings for the study of terrorism and intergroup relations, as well as immigration and counterterrorism policies.},

We confirm earlier research showing that the decline in the congressional swing ratio noted by Tufte (1973) and Calvert and Ferejohn (1984) among others can largely be attributed to a reduction in the number of competitive House seats which has been ongoing for at least 70 years and has, for the entire country, exhibited a near straight-line decline in moving average over virtually the entire period. Rut, following Gudgin and Taylor (1979), we also show that the swing ratio is responsive to the kurtosis of the distribution of Democratic vote share across congressional districts.

Since predispositions acquired early in the life cycle—such as partisanship, religiosity, basic values, and group-based affect/antagonisms—are more crystallized than mass opinion about public policy, media and campaign content will tend to prime citizens' predispositions and change their policy positions.

This article attempts a synthesis by showing that election system and cleavage type interact to affect the number of parties, with the former factor determined in part by the latter. Our most striking finding, however, is that the effective number of parties tends to be obtained by adding ?one? to the number of issue dimensions. Within this broader framework, Duverger's Law emerges as a special case for polities with a single issue dimension, and Duverger's Hypothesis is replaced by a much more quantitative prediction as to the effective number of parties.},

The analysis simulates outcomes in Florida under scenarios consistent with the turnout rates of Georgia and North Carolina ex-felons in 2000 and Florida ex-felons in 2008. Survey evidence on candidate preferences as well as data on ex-felon party registration in Florida and North Carolina are used to produce estimates of support for Bush and Gore among ex-felons. Based on the simulations, the ex-felon population in Florida would have favored Bush in 2000. Assuming that ex-felons supported Gore at rates similar to GSS respondents with at most a high school diploma, Bush would have defeated Gore by 4,925 and 7,048 votes, assuming turnout of 10 and 15{\%}, respectively.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article studies the interplay of U.S. primary and general elections. I examine how the nomination of an extremist changes general-election outcomes and legislative behavior in the U.S. House, 1980–2010, using a regression discontinuity design in primary elections. When an extremist—as measured by primary-election campaign receipt patterns—wins a “coin-flip” election over a more moderate candidate, the party's general-election vote share decreases on average by approximately 9–13 percentage points, and the probability that the party wins the seat decreases by 35–54 percentage points. This electoral penalty is so large that nominating the more extreme primary candidate causes the district's subsequent roll-call representation to reverse, on average, becoming more liberal when an extreme Republican is nominated and more conservative when an extreme Democrat is nominated. Overall, the findings show how general-election voters act as a moderating filter in response to primary nominations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Bacteriophages are highly abundant in human microbiota where they coevolve with resident bacteria.  Phage predation can drive the evolution of bacterial resistance, which can then drive reciprocal evolution in the phage to overcome that resistance. Such coevolutionary dynamics have not been extensively studied in human gut bacteria, and are of particular interest for both understanding and eventually manipulating the human gut microbiome. We performed experimental evolution of an Enterococcus faecium isolate from healthy human stool in the absence and presence of a single infecting Myoviridae bacteriophage, EfV12-phi1. Four replicates of E. faecium and phage were grown with twice daily serial transfers for eight days. Genome sequencing revealed that E. faecium evolved resistance to phage through mutations in the yqwD2 gene involved in exopolysaccharide biogenesis and export, and the rpoC gene which encodes the RNA polymerase $\beta$' subunit. In response to bacterial resistance, phage EfV12-phi1 evolved varying numbers of 1.8 kb tandem duplications within a putative tail fiber gene. Host range assays indicated that coevolution of this phage-host pair resulted in arms race dynamics in which bacterial resistance and phage infectivity increased over time. Tracking mutations from population sequencing of experimental coevolution can quickly illuminate phage entry points along with resistance strategies in both phage and host – critical information for using phage to manipulate microbial communities.},

abstract = {In this article, I defend compulsory voting on the grounds that it reinforces the distinctive and valuable role that elections play in contemporary democracy. Some scholars have suggested that mandatory voting laws can improve government responsiveness to members of poor and marginalized groups who are less likely to vote. Critics of compulsory voting object that citizens can participate in a wide variety of ways; voting is not important enough to justify forcing people to do it. These critics neglect the importance of voting's particular role in contemporary democratic practice, though. The case for compulsory voting rests on an implicit, but widely shared, understanding of elections as special moments of mass participation that manifest the equal political authority of all citizens. The most prominent objections to mandatory voting fail to appreciate this distinctive role for voting and the way it is embedded within a broader democratic framework.},

We show that when vote share is fixed, d = 0 allows for a wide array of possible seat shares, even when turnout in each district is equal. In particular, if d = 0, the majority party has higher seat share when its average vote share in districts that it wins is closer to the statewide vote share. This range of possible seat shares with d = 0 results in a range of responsiveness, again depending on the average vote share in districts won by the majority party. We also prove what kind of vote-share seat-share pairs can result in d = 0 when the maximum district turnout to minimum district turnout is bounded, and turnout is unrestricted. Within our analyses, we show that Declination cannot detect all forms of packing and cracking, and we compare the Declination to the Efficiency Gap. We show that these two metrics can behave quite differently , and give explicit examples of that occurring, including examples from recent election data.},

Judged by the empirical record, it is clear which party truly benefits America's communities of color.

@article{Gastwirth2017,
abstract = {The Gini index is the most commonly used measure of income inequality. Like any single summary measure of a set of data, it cannot capture all aspects that are of interest to researchers. One of its widely reported flaws is that it is supposed to be overly sensitive to changes in the middle of the distribution. By studying the effect of small transfers between households or an additional increment in income going to one member of the population on the value of the index, this claim is reexamined. It turns out that the difference in the rank order of donor and recipient is usually the most important factor determining the change in the Gini index due to the transfer, which implies that transfers from an upper income household to a low income household receive more weight that transfers involving the middle. Transfers between two middle-income households do affect a higher fraction of the population than other transfers but those transfers do not receive an excessive weight relative to other transfers because the difference in the ranks of donor and recipient is smaller than the corresponding difference in other transfers. Thus, progressive transfers between two households in the middle of the distribution changes the Gini index less than a transfer of the same amount from an upper income household to a lower income household. Similarly, the effect on the Gini index when a household in either tail of the distribution receives an additional increment is larger than when a middle-income household receives it. Contrary to much of the literature, these results indicate that the Gini index is not overly sensitive to changes in the middle of the distribution. Indeed, it is more sensitive to changes in the lower and upper parts of the distribution than in the middle.},

In this article, we examine the location and relocation of political capitals in the United States, including the choice of Washington, DC, as the nation's capital and the location and relocation of capitals in the 48 contiguous American states. We argue that the location of capitals in the United States followed a systematic pattern in accord with the theory of representative government developed in the new nation, especially as articulated by Madison. Based on an empirical analysis of historical census and political boundaries data from 1790 to the present, we find that decision makers consistently tended to locate—and especially relocate—the seat of government as near as possible to the population centroid of the relevant political jurisdiction, consistent with the principle of equal representation of citizens. Our analysis contributes to the study of institutional design and change, especially in the area of American political development, as well as to a burgeoning literature on the effects of geographical factors on political outcomes.},

abstract = {[The most recent call for judicial intervention into state partisan gerrymandering practices ran aground on the shoals of standing doctrine in Gill v. Whitford. The First Amendment stood at the center of this latest gerrymandering challenge. Democratic voters claimed that the legislative districting scheme infringed on their associational rights by denying their party an opportunity for fair representation in the state legislature. For the Gill majority, the voters' alleged representational harm was the sort of generalized grievance that failed to satisfy standing's particularized injury requirement. Gill was the latest in a series of First Amendment freedom of association fights between partisan insiders—members or supporters of one of the two major political parties—that dates back to the 1970s. In these fights, the interests and needs of political outsiders—both nonvoters and those unaffiliated with the major political parties—have gone unheard and unaddressed. Political outsiders were not always marginalized in legal controversies involving the freedom of association. In fact, the Supreme Court originally constructed its First Amendment freedom of association doctrine in the 1950s to protect the political activity of dissident minority groups excluded from democratic politics. In this Essay, I argue that advocates should return to the Court's initial freedom of association concern with ensuring the inclusion of political outsiders' voices in the democratic space. Gerrymandering can inflict multiple harms, on both insiders and outsiders. While partisan gerrymandering may deprive one political party of holding power in a way that corresponds to its electoral support in the jurisdiction (a “representational harm”), it can also prevent individuals who do not belong to the majority party in the gerrymandered districts from being able to effectively participate in elections (a “participatory harm”). Both political outsiders and members of the minority party experience this latter harm. I argue that the participatory harm should drive future gerrymandering challenges. Such claims could empower political outsiders, advance minority parties' interest in fair representation, and overcome the standing obstacles laid out by the Court in Gill.]},

We estimate the measurement model using electoral returns and district-level demographic characteristics spanning five decades (1952–2000), letting us assess how the distribution of district partisanship has changed over time, in response to population movements and redistricting, particularly via the creation of majority-minority districts.

Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (2018) the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down as a “severe and durable” partisan gerrymander the congressional map drawn by Republicans in 2011 and used in elections from 2012-2016. It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. After Pennsylvania failed to enact a lawful remedy plan of its own (due to total disagreement as to how to proceed between the newly elected Democratic governor and the still Republican-controlled legislature), the Court then ordered into place for the 2018 election a map of its own drawn for it by a court-appointed consultant. In a split court, the Court map was endorsed only by judges with Democratic affiliations. Here we compare the 2011 and 2018 congressional maps in terms of a variety of proposed metrics for detecting partisan gerrymandering. We also examine the remedy map proposed by a group of Republican legislators and that proposed by the Democratic governor. We conclude that the 2011 map was a blatant and undisguised pro-Republican gerrymander. Moreover, the remedy map proposed by Republican legislators was a covert pro-Republican gerrymander (what we refer to as a “stealth gerrymander”). The Democratic governor's proposed plan cannot be classified as a pro-Democratic gerrymander and indeed has, if anything, a slight pro-Republican tilt. The 2018 court-drawn remedial map, by all measures, was not a gerrymander.},

abstract = {Contemporary efforts to evaluate representation often compare survey measures of how citizens say they would vote on legislation to what elected officials do in office. These comparisons generally suggest poor representation. We argue here that this common design is unlikely to effectively evaluate representation because responses to survey questions differ in important aspects from voting in legislatures. Measurement error and construct validity undermine the comparison. Three survey experiments show that providing partisan and nonpartisan information readily available to legislators materially changes respondents' expressed preferences on roll-call votes. With information, expressed policy positions are both less centrist and more closely matched to legislator behavior in their preferred party. Respondents also appear aware of their own lack of knowledge in evaluating roll-call policy votes. The treatment effect of information decreases in confidence judging policy in that area. We show similar patterns for respondent opinions on Supreme Court decisions. U nderstanding representation is a central and long-standing research topic in political science. How much do elected officials do what citizens want? Among the most common empirical assessments of the quality of representation are studies that calculate the correspondence between an elected official's behavior and the preferences of his or her constituents. Two potential ways to measure correspondence are to ask (1) would the citizen do something different if granted the legisla-tor's vote, or (2) would she punish or reward the legislator on the basis of the legislator's vote if she were aware of it? Recently, both forms of research have turned to comparing the roll-call votes cast by members of Congress with survey measures of the preferences of constituents on those same roll-calls. To measure the first version of representation, the researcher compares whether survey respondents' expressed preferences comport with how their member voted. To measure the second version of representation, scholars inform respondents how the member voted and see whether it changes respondents' Seth J. Hill is Associate Professor,},

abstract = {Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor famously declared in Shaw v. Reno that ''appearances do matter'' when it comes to the shape of congressional districts. Although there are no definitive legal requirements for districts' geographical appearances, the argument is widely posited that more compact districts are better. The reasoning often asserts, and empirical studies have shown, that compactness improves communication between representatives and constituents, increases political information flows, produces fairer results, as well as restricts excessive gerrymandering. These, in turn, can all increase political participation and improve the legitimacy of our representative institutions. Despite this conventional wisdom, there is little empirical evidence on the electoral effects of compactness. Using a dataset on the compact-ness of U.S. House districts-with multiple measures generated by geographic information system (GIS) analyses over two redistricting cycles, I estimate the effects of congressional district compactness on electoral turnout and argue that Sandra Day O'Connor is correct: ''appearances do matter.''},

By measuring the timing of voting by demographic subgroups within small geographic areas, we assess how the early voting period may differentially affect various politically relevant subsets of the electorate.

abstract = {Scholarship on electoral turnout has long emphasized two main themes: explanations of nonvoting in terms of individual characteristics and in terms of contextual variables. These investigations have deeply enriched our understanding of electoral participation, but their limitations have also sensitized us to the remaining problems of explanation. Perusal of the work on American politics exposes a rather striking tendency in studies of participation to ignore, or soft pedal, the effects of active political mobilization. In this article we formulate two models of electoral turnout--socioeconomic and political mobilization--and apply them to aggregate data on voting in gubernatorial elections of 1978 and 1980. The socioeconomic model of turnout includes such influences as income, age, and educational attainment. To assess the effects of political mobilization, we have considered campaign spending, partisan competition, electoral margin, and the presence or absence of a simultaneous race for the United States Senate. Both of the models perform quite well individually, producing significant and meaningful coefficients and adequate fits. Yet in the final analysis we demonstrate that quite apart from major sources of variation in gubernatorial turnout--such as region and presidential versus nonpresidential years--the mobilizing influences of campaign activism and competitiveness have a strong impact on electoral participation; electoral law, i.e., closing date of registration, retains a small but significant effect on voting for governor; and socioeconomic characteristics, include in a fully specified model, have little to contribute independently to an explanation of electoral turnout. These findings are very much in the same vein as related cross-national investigations which emphasize the crucial role of electoral law and political parties and downplay individual characteristics as determinants of electoral participation. On the basis of the research reported here, we argue that scholars need to pay more attention to political mobilization as an explanation of electoral turnout.},

One of the more commonly recurring themes among observers of congressional politics is that changes in district boundaries resulting from the redistricting process are a root cause. Using a new data set linking congressional districts from 1962 to 2002, we offer a direct test of this claim. Our results show that although there is an overall trend of increasing polarization, districts that have undergone significant changes as a result of redistricting have become even more polarized. Although the effect is relatively modest, it suggests that redistricting is one among other factors that produce party polarization in the House and may help to explain the elevated levels of polarization in the House relative to the Senate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Sage Publications.},

The great variation in state population means that some states have far greater need for federal funds than others, but all senators have equal voting weight. As a result, even though all senators' votes are of equal value to the coalition builder, they are not of equal “price.” Coalition builders can include benefits for small states at considerably less expense to program budgets than comparable benefits for more populous states. Building on formal models of coalition building, two hypotheses are developed and tested. First, coalition builders will seek out less costly members to build supportive coalitions efficiently. Second, the final outcomes of distributive policy will more closely reflect the preferences of small-state senators than large-state senators. The hypotheses are tested by examining the 1991 and 1997–98 reauthorizations of federal surface transportation programs. The findings support both hypotheses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The concept has been broadened not only to reflect changes in theory but also in response to social and technological developments. As a result, a wide and ever increasing variety of definitions and conceptualizations are currently employed. Jan van Deth proposes an encompassing conceptual map in order to capture past, present and future forms of political participation. Marc Hooghe and Beng{\"{u}} Hosch-Dayican criticize his proposal.

abstract = {Models of party competition building on Downs (1957) have recognized that there are centrifugal and centripetal forces in party competition; but one such force, the existence of party primaries, has been remarkably neglected in recent literature. We consider party/candidate policy divergence in two-party competition in one dimension where there is a two-stage electoral process, e.g., a primary election (or caucus) among party supporters to select that party's candidate followed by a general election. We develop a model in which (some or all) voters in the primary election are concerned with the likelihood that the primary victor will be able to win the general election and being concerned with that candidate's policy position. This model is similar in all but technical details to that given in an almost totally neglected early paper in Public Choice Coleman (1971) 11:35-60, but we offer important new results on electoral dynamics for candidate locations. In addition to accounting for persistent party divergence by incorporating a more realistic model of the institutions that govern elections in the U.S., the model we offer gives rise to predictions that match a number of important aspects of empirical reality such as frequent victories for incumbents and greater than otherwise expected electoral success for the minority party in situations where that party has its supporters more closely clustered ideologically than the supporters of the larger party (in particular, with a concentration of voters between the party mean and the population mean).},

Variables corresponding to the private “selective incentives” associated with protest are found to be less relevant.

abstract = {In parliamentary democracies, the transfer of power from one government to the next is sometimes characterized by long periods of negotiations in which party leaders bargain over the composition and policy objectives of a new cabinet. Although these delays can have substantial political and economic consequences, surprisingly little is known about their determinants. Moreover, the few studies that exist reach contradictory conclusions. In this article, the author examines how factors relating to uncertainty and bargaining complexity influence the duration of the government formation process in 16 West European countries from 1944 to 1998. In line with the article's theoretical expectations, the author finds that factors increasing uncertainty over the type of cabinet that is acceptable always lead to delays in forming governments but that factors increasing bargaining complexity, such as the number of parties and ideological polarization in the legislature, only do so when there is sufficient uncertainty among political actors. The present analysis helps to resolve the contradictory findings in the literature.},

This distribution can have important, if sometimes hidden, consequences. In the case of universities, considering the mean class size as given, three nonobvious consequences of the amount of variation in class size are examined. (1) The average class size experienced by students is directly related to the amount of variation in class size. (2) Overall student attendance is inversely related to the amount of variation in class size. (3) Overall student participation time is directly related to the amount of variation in class size. The logic of these relationships is explored, and data on 49 departments and interdisciplinary programs at one university are used to illustrate the nature and extent of the class size paradox at one university.},

This article looks at the last 50 years of demographic change, one of the most extraordinary periods in demographic history. During this period, world population grew at rates that have never been seen before and will almost surely never be seen again. There were many concerns about the potential impact of rapid population growth in the 1960s, including mass starvation in countries such as India, depletion of nonrenewable resources, and increased poverty in low-income countries. The actual experience was very different. World food production increased faster than world population in every decade since the 1960s, resource prices fell during most of the period, and poverty declined significantly in much of the developing world. The article considers the economic and demographic explanations for the surprising successes of this important period in demographic history. It also looks at regions that have been less successful, especially Africa, and at the lessons for dealing with the important challenges that still remain.},

abstract = {Worries about the instability of political attitudes and lack of ideological constraint among the public are often pacified by the assumption that individuals have stable political values. These political values are assumed to help individuals filter political information and thus both minimize outside influence and guide people through complex political environments. This perspective, though, assumes that political values are stable and consistent across contexts. This piece questions that assumption and argues that political values are socially reinforced—that is, that political values are not internal predispositions, but the result of social influence. I consider this idea with two empirical tests: an experimental test that recreates the transmission of political values and an observational analysis of the effect of politically homogeneous social contexts on political value endorsements. Results suggest that political values are socially reinforced. The broader implication of my findings is that the concepts scholars term “political values” may be reflections of individuals' social contexts rather than values that govern individual political behavior.},

An election administration policy in California, in which all voters are assigned to VBM based on an arbitrary threshold of the number of registered voters, is exploited to overcome the identification problem caused by the self-selection of voters into VBM. We show that the use of VBM affects the relative performance of candidates remaining in the race and increases the probability of selecting withdrawn candidates. Our findings have implications both for election administration policy and for the study of campaign effects in American elections.

In the United Kingdom, redistricting recommendations are made by independent Boundary Commissions, but the political parties can influence the nature of those recommendations through the representations that they make during the consultative process. When a Commission has made provisional recommendations for a county (in England and Wales), region (in Scotland) or London borough, individuals and organizations have one month in which to make written representations, either favourable or unfavourable, regarding all or part of the recommendations, and they can suggest alternative sets of constituencies for the area concerned. The Commission may then hold a public inquiry, at which the interested parties can promote their views and contest those put forward by others. The assistant commissioner who conducts the inquiry reports to the commission, which may publish alterations to the provisional recommendations as a result of his/her advice. If their suggestions are adopted by the Commission for its final recommendations, then those promoting them at the public inquiry will have influenced the redistricting outcome.},

Both the 1950s era of ideologically innocent party voting and the subsequent period of partisan dealignment are over. Some political scientists began to describe the New American Voter as a new partisan evolution occurred. What has not been fully appreciated in the twentieth/twenty-first century history of voting studies is how partisanship returned in a form more ideological and more issue based along liberal-conservative lines than it has been in more than 30 years. This is visible in the strength of partisan voting, in the relationship between partisanship and ideology, and in the strength of the relationship of partisanship and self-reported liberal-conservative ideology to the public's economic, social, racial, and religious attitudes and opinions. Not only has the public responded in a striking way to changes in politics and its context, but the current transformation has also appeared to be strikingly enduring and difficult to shake, based on survey evidence for this new partisan voter.},

Particular concern has been focused on so-called ''dark money'' groups, which have the ability to solicit unlimited and undisclosed donations-most of which pay for television ads. Research suggests that unknown group-sponsored ads are more effective than ads sponsored by candidates. This analysis examines whether the effectiveness of unfamiliar dark-money ads can be mitigated by disclosing to viewers that the ad was paid for by a ''dark money'' group. To understand the impact of these factors, we conducted a series of experiments that manipulated the involvement of the groups and whether the groups were specifically partisan in nature. We find that, in the absence of a partisan cue, disclosing that a candidate benefits from dark money tends to reduce support for that candidate. When partisan cues are given, however, people ''punish'' candidates of the opposing party.},

First, the initial increase and subsequent decline in news media attention devoted to policing post-Ferguson are associated with corresponding rises and wanes in the amount of policing legislation proposed and passed across state legislatures.

However, an important question that has been raised is whether van Deth's map actually achieves its main goal of unambiguously identifying and classifying emerging, complex types of participation, like online political activism - or lifestyle politics. To contribute to this debate, this article aims to evaluate the usefulness of van Deth's approach for the analysis of lifestyle politics. Such an evaluation requires a clear classification of lifestyle politics. This, however, is still missing from the literature. The second aim of this article, therefore, is to identify and classify different types of lifestyle politics. On the basis of a literature review, this article argues that lifestyle politics are often enacted throughout different private, public and institutional arenas, and that they are often targeted at various social, economic and political actors at once. Applying van Deth's conceptual map to these empirical realities, then, suggests that it cannot always account for their complexity sufficiently. Therefore, this article proposes a modification of van Deth's framework that increases its usefulness for analyzing emerging, complex political participation repertoires.},

Using an original survey conducted in 15 Massachusetts communities, we explore whether citizens have meaningful preferences about the communities with whom they share the same representative. To the extent they do, we test whether these preferences are driven by geographic considerations or other factors such as partisanship, race, and socioeconomic status. Our findings not only offer the opportunity to refine the concept of “communities of interest” to account for voter preferences but also more broadly speak to the literature on the increasingly political nature of residential preferences and their impact on political attitudes, participation, and voting behavior.},

abstract = {Objective. Record numbers of first-and second-generation immigrants have won elected office over the last few electoral cycles, yet we find immigrants are still underrepresented at all levels of government. What are the perceived barriers to entry into political life among these New Americans? Method. Using a unique survey data set that includes an oversample of first-and second-generation immigrants who have enrolled in civic leadership trainings, we examine the similarities and differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant leaders. Results. We find that immigrants are in many ways similar to their nonimmigrant counterparts in that access to structural resources help shape their political ambition. Yet immigrants, unlike their nonimmigrant counterparts, often have less of these resources and perceive their ability to capitalize on these resources as less feasible. Conclusions. We find that the traditional barriers to office-lack of professional and political experiences , finances, and monied networks-all contribute to lower self-perceived qualifications for office among both immigrants and nonimmigrants. Yet, the New American leaders who are highly politically involved, deeply rooted in their communities, and well-positioned to run for office face the additional psychological barriers posed by their race and ethnicity, immigrant identity, citizenship status, language ability, and acculturation, barriers that are often offered in open-ended essays as self-evident and crippling. Leadership training programs play a crucial role in providing training and instilling confidence in would-be immigrant candidates.},

abstract = {[The number of minorities serving in legislatures, councils, and governing boards varies greatly across regions of the country and across levels of government. For example, on the national level, there are more black members of Congress in the North than in the South, while at the local level more blacks serve in the South than in the North. This paper accounts for the variation in black representation primarily as an interaction of the concentration of blacks (in both raw population numbers and in population percentages) and the size of the constituency unit. We show that electoral geography is the single most important element in explaining variations in black representation in government by section and by type of office. We are not claiming, however, that electoral geography is the only major influence on minority electoral success. We recognize that election method is critical; in particular, it is well known that at-large elections produce fewer minority representatives than other systems, independent of the effects of geography. But we show that election method does not vary as greatly by region as does electoral geography. Thus, regional differences in black representation across levels of government can best be explained by making sense of electoral geography.]},

@article{GrofmanHyman1973,
abstract = {This paper seeks to develop a formal (mathematical) model of belief systems based on the axioms of probability theory and propositional logic. By a belief system we mean a set of propositions along with an actor's objective probability assignments to (beliefs in) them, together with the relationships among and between propositions and beliefs. Belief systems are regarded as being comprised of interrelated elements. In the paper are developed measures of the distance between sets of beliefs; of the congruence, coherence, and consistency of belief systems; and of the degree of polarization of belief systems-which are derived from one basic operation, symmetric difference. We show that these measures possess a number of useful and powerful mathematical properties. Also, a model is set forth by which, from an actor's subjective probability assignment to propositions and pairwise conjunctions of propositions, we may then impute to the actor subjectively perceived truth functional relationships between propositions. The potential uses and practical difficulties with the approach taken in the paper are also discussed, and the assertion is made that the measures developed enable us to simply distinguish between certain notions (e.g., congruence, consistency, coherence) too often and easily confused, provide us with the possibility of interval (or at least, quasi-interval level) measurement of certain properties of individual belief systems, and also allows us to make comparisons between the structures of different actors' belief systems. Central to the research design of this paper is the notion that belief systems comprise interrelated elements and that changes in some elements of the system can be expected to (eventually 1) effect changes in other elements of the system. Our aim is to present a measurement model which will make these linkages among beliefs and changes therein subject to precise empirical measurement. We shall denote individual propositions by lower case letters, and sets of propositions by capitals. We shall denote by at, a2,..., a, the propositions in a set A which may be conjectured to be part of some belief system A'. We shall use the familiar logical operators-,, 'implies'; 'equivalent to';-negation'; {\^{}} 'and'; v 'or' to represent relationships (among propositions) as perceived by some given actor(s). Similarly, we shall use the set theoretic operators u, union; c{\~{}} intersection; e, membership in; =, is included in; =, includes; to represent relationships among sets. Let us denote byp (a{\~{}}) the (subjective) probability that an actor assigns to Theory and Decision 4 (1973) 179-195.},

abstract = {This article examines the sources of ideological skepticism about two issues where there is a scientific consensus: climate change and evolution. The results indicate that self-identified conservatives doubt global warming in large part because of elite rhetoric, but that evolution beliefs are unrelated to reception of political discourse. News reception is perhaps the strongest predictor of conservatives' climate change skepticism, but has no influence on their aversion to evolution. Moreover, the article leverages three sources of variation in elite discourse on climate change—temporal, cross-national, and experimental—to show that changes in the prevalence of ideological cues strongly affect public opinion about global warming. Politically attentive conservatives, in fact, were more likely to believe scientists about global warming than liberals were in the 1990s before the media depicted climate change as a partisan issue. The United States is also the only nation where political interest significantly predicts both conservatives' skepticism about, and liberals' belief in, climate change. Finally, evidence from a national survey experiment suggests that Americans would be less skeptical of manmade global warming if more Republicans in Congress believed in it, but a growing Congressional consensus about evolution would not diminish doubts about its existence.},

abstract = {As the current redistricting cycle unfolds, the courts are stuck in limbo. The Supreme Court has held unanimously that political gerrymandering can be unconstitutional- but it has also rejected every standard suggested to date for distinguishing lawful from unlawful district plans. This Article offers a way out of the impasse. It proposes that courts resolve gerrymandering disputes by examining how well districts correspond to organic geographic communities. Districts ought to be upheld when they coincide with such communities, but struck down when they unnecessarily disrupt them. This approach, which I call the "territorial community test," has a robust theoretical pedigree. In fact, the proposition that communities develop geographically and require legislative representation has won wide acceptance for most of American history. The courts have also employed variants of the test (without scholars previously having noticed) in several related fields: reapportionment, racial gerrymandering, racial vote dilution, etc. The principle of districtcommunity congruence thus animates much of the relevant case law already. The test is largely unscathed, furthermore, by the unmanageability critique that has doomed every other potential redistricting standard. The courts have shown for decades that they can compare district and community boundaries, and the social science literature confirms the feasibility of such comparisons. Finally, the political implications of the test's adoption would likely be positive. My empirical analysis suggests that partisan bias would decrease, relative to the status quo, while electoral responsiveness and voter participation would rise. It is true that the territorial community test does not directly address partisan motives or outcomes. But the Court has made clear that it views these issues as doctrinal dead ends. Ironically, the only way left to combat gerrymandering might be to strike at something other than its heart.},

@article{Ross2019,
abstract = {A recent spate of election laws tightened registration rules, reduced convenient voting opportunities, and required voters to show specific types of identification in order to vote. Because these laws make voting more difficult, critics have analogized them to Jim Crow Era voter suppression laws. We challenge the analogy that current restrictive voting laws are a reincarnation of Jim Crow Era voter suppression. While there are some notable similarities, the analogy obscures a more apt comparison to a different form of voter suppression—one that operates to effectively disfranchise an entire class of people, just as the old form did for African Americans. This form of suppression excludes the poor. To account for the effective disfranchisement of the poor, we develop a more robust theory of voting than currently exists in the legal literature. Drawing on rational choice and sociological theories of voting, we show how information, affiliation with formal organizations, and integration into social networks of politically active individuals are far more important to the decision to vote than the tangible costs of voting associated with the new voter suppression. Using this expanded account of voting, we identify the role of political parties and their mobilization activities in the effective disfranchisement of the poor. Relying on the same proprietary data as the Obama campaign in 2008 and 2012 (and hundreds of campaigns since), along with other public sources of data, we show how campaigns employ a “calculus of contact” to decide whom to mobilize. That calculus leads campaigns to disproportionately neglect the poor when canvassing, calling, and sending political mailers to potential voters—mobilization activities that have a sizeable turnout effect. In our view, the most significant voter suppression tactics of the twenty-first century are therefore not what legislatures are doing, but what campaigns are not doing. We argue that a first step in combating this passive voter suppression should involve changing the information environment of campaigns: The amount and type of information about potential voters that the state makes available to campaigns. Such a change could force campaigns to adjust their calculus of contact and contact more low-income people during election season. Including the poor as targets of campaign mobilization would be an important first step toward a more egalitarian democracy.},

abstract = {Partisan gerrymandering arises when many single-district gerrymanders are combined to obtain an overall advantage. The Supreme Court has held that partisan gerrymandering is recognizable by its asymmetry: for a given distribution of popular votes, if the parties switch places in popular vote, the numbers of seats would change in an unequal fashion. However, the asymmetry standard is only a broad statement of principle, and no analytical method for assessing asymmetry has yet been held to be manageable. Recently I proposed (68 Stanford Law Review 1263) three statistical tests to reliably assess asymmetry in state-level districting schemes: (a) a discrepancy in winning vote margins between the two parties' seats; (b) undue reliable wins for the party in charge of redistricting, as measured by the mean-median difference in vote share, or by an unusually even distribution of votes across districts; and (c) unrepresentative distortion in the number of seats won based on expectations from nationwide district characteristics. These tests use district-level election outcomes, do not require the drawing of maps, and are accessible via nearly any desktop computer. Each test probes a facet of partisan asymmetry. The first two tests analyze intent using well-established, century-old statistical tests. Once intents are established, the effects of gerrymandering can be analyzed using the third test, which is calculated rapidly by computer simulation. The three tests show that two current cases, the Wisconsin State Assembly (Whitford v. Nichol) and the Maryland congressional delegation (Shapiro v. McManus), meet criteria for a partisan gerrymander. I propose that an intents-and-effects standard based on one or more of these tests is robust enough to mitigate the need to demonstrate predominant partisan intent. The three statistical standards offered here add to the judge's toolkit for rapidly and rigorously identifying the consequences of partisan redistricting.},

@techreport{Wrighton1997,
abstract = {We examine how changes in the incidence of uncontested seats for the U.S. House of Representatives over time reflect responses to partisan change, changes in electoral rules, and long-term secular changes in the American political system. We use a multiple interrupted times series model to test the relationship between the number of uncontested House seats from 1912 to 1994 and the 1932 realignment, midterm elections, the rise of the Republican South, redistricting, the abolition of cross-filing laws in California, and the pronounced rise of the incumbency advantage since 1966. We test models explaining the number of uncontested House seats occupied by each party and the difference between the parties in the number of those seats. We find that the rise of the Republican South started in 1964 and the incidence of midterm elections contributed strongly to changes in the overall rate of uncontested House races. T he incidence of uncontested seats is one indicator of the competitiveness of an electoral system. The goal of our study is to explain the level of competition for the U.S. House of Representatives over the 42 general elections from 1912 to 1994 by looking at the number of uncontested seats. The overtime variance in systemic levels of competition in congressional elections is a relatively un-studied area in American politics.' Using the number of uncontested seats, we examine the overall competition over this 82-year period, the level of competition experienced by each major party, and the difference in the level of competition between the parties. Our findings show that competition for the House, as measured by the number of uncontested seats, has increased over the years. This suggests that at this very basic level of competition, American democracy is healthier than at any other time this century. This is a revised version of a paper presented at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association, April 6-8, 1995. 'Notable exceptions to this are Alford and Brady (1993); Garand and Gross (1984), and Garand, Wink and Vincent (1993). Squire (1989) details a number of district-level and candidate-specific characteristics that contribute to increasing or decreasing the probability of uncontested races.

abstract = {Ever since the Supreme Court instituted the one person, one vote principle in congressional elections based on its decision in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964), intrastate deviations from equal district populations have become smaller and smaller after each decennial reapportionment. Relying on equal total population as the standard to meet the Court's principle, though, has raised some constitutional and practical questions stemming from, most basically, not every person has the right to vote. Specifically, there is considerable deviation between the current redistricting practices and a literal interpretation of this constitutional principle. This study systematically analyzes the differences between districts' total populations and their voting age populations (VAPs). Further, we consider how congressional reapportionments since 1972 would change if, instead of states' total populations, the standard for reapportioning seats were based on the VAP or the voting eligible population (VEP). Overall, the results indicate that the debate surrounding the appropriate apportionment and redistricting standard is not just normative, it also has notable practical consequences.},

An examination of all amendments in the 50 American state since 1776 reveals patterns that are then confirmed using data from 32 national constitutions. The interaction of the two key variables affedcting amendment rate can be described by an equation that generates predicted amendment rates close to those found in the cross-national empirical analysis. A constitution's length measured in number of words, the difficulty of an amendment process, and the rate of amendment turn out to have interlocking consequences that illuminate principles of constitutional design.},

We allow both a policymaker and a lobby to gather information, and each can either fund or subsidize policymaking. Our analysis highlights that legislative subsidies are both chosen strategically by lobbyists and strategically induced by policymakers, dependent on the circumstances. These involve which resource constraints bind the policymaker's prior beliefs, the salience of policy, and the policymaker's and lobby's expertise in information gathering. Our results highlight five distinct motives for informational lobbying and demonstrate that for both a lobby and policymaker, there can be strategic advantages arising from being resource-constrained.},

In Study 1, cross-national analyses show that parties behave more programmatically under compulsory voting and that vote buying is less common where voting is mandatory. In Study 2, synthetic control and difference-in-differences analyses show that a switch to compulsory voting in Thailand produced an increase in programmatic vote seeking. In Study 3, a list experiment conducted in tandem with a natural experiment shows that compulsory voting leads parties to rely less on vote-buying tactics in Argentina.

abstract = {Barth{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}my et al. (2014), extending the work of Neubauer and Zeitlin (2003), show that some U.S. presidential elections are subject to a ‘House size effect' in that the winner of the election, i.e., the candidate who wins a majority of electoral votes, depends on the size of the House of Representatives. The conditions for the effect relate to the number of ‘Senate' versus ‘House' electoral votes won by each candidate, but the relationship is not straightforward due to ‘locally chaotic' effects in the apportionment of House seats among the states as House size changes. Clearly a Presidential election that is subject to the House size effect exhibits the referendum paradox, i.e., the electoral vote winner is the popular vote loser, for some House sizes but not for others.},

These weak findings are partially due to insufficient attention to measurement and sampling issues. Concerning measurement, many studies examine the percent of registered citizens that turn out to vote, a measure that unnecessarily distorts the effect of electoral system. Concerning samples, electoral systems will have a larger impact on turnout in more fully democratic countries, given that the vote itself is more meaningful in a full democracy. Taking into account these distinctions, electoral systems in fact have a strongly significant effect on turnout in fully democratic countries, while having relatively little effect in partially democratic countries. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Journal of the American Statistical Association ISSN: 0162-1459 (Print) 1537-274X (Online) Journal homepage: http://amstat.tandfonline.com/loi/uasa20 ABSTRACT In democratic countries, voting is one of the most important ways for citizens to influence policy and hold their representatives accountable. And yet, in the United States and many other countries, rates of voter turnout are alarmingly low. Every election cycle, mobilization efforts encourage citizens to vote and ensure that elections reflect the true will of the people. To establish the most effective way of encouraging voter turnout, this article seeks to differentiate between (1) the synergy hypothesis that multiple instances of voter contact increase the effectiveness of a single form of contact, and (2) the diminishing returns hypothesis that multiple instances of contact are less effective or even counterproductive. Remarkably, previous stud-ies have been unable to compare these hypotheses because extant approaches to analyzing experiments with noncompliance cannot speak to questions of causal interaction. I resolve this impasse by extending the traditional instrumental variables framework to accommodate multiple treatment–instrument pairs, which allows for the estimation of conditional and interaction effects to adjudicate between synergy and dimin-ishing returns. The analysis of two voter mobilization field experiments provides the first evidence of dimin-ishing returns to follow-up contact and a cautionary tale about experimental design for these quantities. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We also provide an intuitive motivation for why legislative outcomes in the spatial context may be expected to lie close to the Copeland winner. Finally, we show a connection between the Copeland winner and the Shapley value and provide a simple but powerful algorithm to calculate the Copeland scores of all points in the space in terms of the (modified) power values of each of the voters and their locations in the space.},

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature—defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all. Because real-world redistricting and gerrymandering involve complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.},

abstract = {Abstract: We study the deterrent effects of whistleblower protections on firms exposed to the protections. Legislators generally intend to deter behavior at all firms exposed to whistleblower protections when passing whistleblower protections. However, prior studies in the tax area do not focus on broad deterrent effects. We hypothesize that state whistleblower protections deter state corporate income tax avoidance at firms exposed to the law. Whistleblower protections increase the marginal costs of tax avoidance by increasing the probability of detection. Thus, whistleblower protections should reduce state corporate income tax avoidance. We use the passage of state False Claims Acts (FCAs) in seven states as plausibly exogenous increases in whistleblower protections. We rely on two measures of state tax avoidance to ensure our results are not driven by dependent variable choice. We use a staggered difference-in-differences design to test our hypothesis. We find that the passage of FCAs reduce state corporate income tax avoidance relative to firms unexposed to the FCA and relative to before the passage of the FCA. Our results are consistent with whistleblower protections deterring state corporate income tax avoidance. In addition, we show FCA deterrence is particularly pronounced in risk-taking firms, consistent with risk-taking firms engaging in more potentially illegal tax avoidance and thus reacting strongly to whistleblower protections. We also find that FCA deterrent effects are particularly pronounced in Republican states relative to Democratic states consistent with firms in states with strong anti-tax avoidance norms avoiding less taxes ex ante and thus reacting little to whistleblower protections. Overall, our study provides evidence that whistleblower protections effectively deter state corporate income tax avoidance.},

Turnout is consistently related to certain attitudinal and social characteristics in all three elections, while others vary in their association with turnout. Election administration procedures are of limited importance in accounting for turnout, while some of the electoral context variables have a significant impact on voting participation patterns. One of the paradoxes of electoral behavior during the past two decades is that while electoral laws, rules, and administrative practices have been altered to facilitate voting, and while television has eased access to information about the more visually presentable aspects of elections, participation in elections has tended to decline. One expression of the disaggregation of the political system noted by Burnham (1970) and Pomper (1977) is that many state and local elections are held simultaneously with the midterm federal elections rather than the presidential elections ; however, less than half of the eligible electorate participate in these midterm elections. Voting participation in the United States, in comparison with other developed democracies, can only be described as low.},

Respondents were resurveyed at the end of the month to measure the effect of this treatment , and at regular intervals throughout the study period to monitor treatment compliance. We find that Republicans who followed a liberal Twitter bot became substantially more conservative posttreatment.

abstract = {Public goods in the United States are largely funded and delivered at the local level. Local public goods are valuable, but their production requires overcoming several collective action problems including coordinating supply and minimizing congestion, free-riding, and peer effects. Land use regulations, promulgated by local governments, allow communities to solve the collective action problems inherent in the provision of local public goods and maintenance of property values. A consequence of these efforts is residential segregation between cities along racial lines. I provide evidence that more stringent land use regulations are supported by whiter communities and that they preserve racial homogeneity. First, I show that cities that were whiter than their metropolitan area in 1970 are more likely to have restrictive land use patterns in 2006. Then, relying on Federal Fair Housing Act lawsuits to generate changes in land use policy, I show that restrictive land use helps to explain metropolitan area segregation patterns over time. Finally, I draw on precinct level initiative elections from several California cities to show that whiter neighborhoods are more supportive of restricting development. These results strongly suggest that even facially race-neutral land use policies have contributed to racial segregation.},

This monoculture is evident in the way we currently train graduate students in IPE and in the gatekeeping practices of the leading international relations journals. Fortunately, there is a continued diversity of work appear- ing in other fora from that surveyed by Maliniak and Tierney, primarily in book form and in alternative journals. The absence of cross-fertilization from these alternative outlets to the high status journals and graduate syllabi por- tends poorly for the future of the field. Like agricultural crops susceptible to devastating collapse for lack of diversification, an intellectual monoculture in IPE may be unable to effectively respond to the dramatic changes and critical emerging issues in the world economy today.},

abstract = {In this article, we consider the relationship between voter turnout and voter evaluations of the candidates. Using thermometer data and the 1976 voter validation study, we investigate the magnitude of indifference, alienation, and satisfaction effects. Overall, we find candidate-based abstention in 1976 to be minimal, suggesting that nonvoting in American presidential elections must be understood in terms of factors unrelated to parties' choices of nominees. To what extent is nonvoting due to short-term forces associated with attitudes toward the candidates running for office? Much casual and some scholarly thinking about turnout in American elections supposes that many people choose not to vote because of their feelings about the candidates. In particular, the rational choice literature has formalized the notions of abstention due to indifference toward the candidates (Downs, 1957) and abstention due to alienation toward all candidates (Garvey, 1966; Hinich and Ordeshook, 1969). The main empirical analysis of these effects is in two articles on the 1968 presidential election. Brody and Page (1973) found indifference and alienation effects on voting turnout in that election, with indifference having the greater effect, while Hinich's (1978) spatial analysis found support for the indifference model among Republicans and the alienation model among Democrats.},

@article{Douglas2014_RightToVote,
abstract = {This Article provides the first comprehensive look at state constitutional provisions explicitly granting the right to vote. We hear that the right to vote is "fundamental," the "essence of a democratic society," and "preservative of all rights." But courts and scholars are still searching for a solution to the puzzle of how best to protect voting rights, especially because the U.S. Supreme Court has underenforced the right to vote. The answer, however, is right in front of us: state constitutions. Virtually every state constitution includes direct, explicit language granting the right to vote, as contrasted with the U.S. Constitution, which mentions voting rights only implicitly. Yet those seeking to protect the right to vote have largely ignored the force of state constitutions, particularly because many state courts "lockstep" their state constitutional voting provisions with the narrow protection the U.S. Supreme Court has afforded under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. This mode of analysis curtails the broader explicit grant of voting rights in state constitutions. This Article explains why the lockstepping approach is wrong for the right to vote and advocates for courts to use a state-focused methodology when construing their state constitutions. It does so through the lens of recent voter ID litigation, showing how the outcome of state constitutional challenges to voter ID laws turns on whether the reviewing state court faithfully and independently applies the state constitutional provision conferring voting rights. The textual and substantive differences between U.S. and state constitutional voting-rights protections requires a state-focused methodology for state constitutional clauses that grant the right to vote. Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution points directly to state qualification rules to determine voter eligibility. State constitutions explicitly confer voting rights, while the U.S. Constitution merely implies the right to vote through negative language. In addition, the right to vote deserves the most robust protection possible, which is generally provided within state constitutions. The Article proposes a test for state courts to use when construing their constitutional voting rights clauses: a court should hold a law that adds an additional voter qualification beyond what the state constitution allows to be presumptively invalid; accordingly, courts should require a state to justify burdens on the right to vote with specific evidence tied to the legislature's authority under the state constitution. Finally, an Appendix presents a chart illustrating all fifty state constitutions and the language they employ for the right to vote.},

@article{Wang2016a,
abstract = {Partisan gerrymandering arises when many single-district gerrymanders are combined to obtain an overall advantage. The Supreme Court has held that partisan gerrymandering is recognizable by its asymmetry: for a given distribution of popular votes, if the parties switch places in popular vote, the numbers of seats would change in an unequal fashion. However, the asymmetry standard is only a broad statement of principle, and no analytical method for assessing asymmetry has yet been held to be manageable. Recently I proposed (68 Stanford Law Review 1263) three statistical tests to reliably assess asymmetry in state-level districting schemes: (a) a discrepancy in winning vote margins between the two parties' seats; (b) undue reliable wins for the party in charge of redistricting, as measured by the mean-median difference in vote share, or by an unusually even distribution of votes across districts; and (c) unrepresentative distortion in the number of seats won based on expectations from nationwide district characteristics. These tests use district-level election outcomes, do not require the drawing of maps, and are accessible via nearly any desktop computer. Each test probes a facet of partisan asymmetry. The first two tests analyze intent using well-established, century-old statistical tests. Once intents are established, the effects of gerrymandering can be analyzed using the third test, which is calculated rapidly by computer simulation. The three tests show that two current cases, the Wisconsin State Assembly (Whitford v. Nichol) and the Maryland congressional delegation (Shapiro v. McManus), meet criteria for a partisan gerrymander. I propose that an intents-and-effects standard based on one or more of these tests is robust enough to mitigate the need to demonstrate predominant partisan intent. The three statistical standards offered here add to the judge's toolkit for rapidly and rigorously identifying the consequences of partisan redistricting.},

One institution that garnered little attention, but nonetheless affected the outcome, was apportionment. A few commentators, looking ahead to 2004, noticed that Bush would have won more comfortably had the apportionment based on the 2000 census already been in place for the 2000 election. Little attention, however, was paid to the method by which 1990 census data were used to generate the 1992-2000 apportionment, even though there are many ways to perform that allocation, the United States has used different methods over its history, and the precise algorithm turned out, in this instance, to matter. More generally, previous discussions of apportionment methods have neglected the point that allocation to states of US House seats simultaneously determines Electoral College weights. Since the Electoral College has built-in biases favoring small states, an apportionment method that partially offsets this bias might be justifiable. We revisit some criteria by which one might prefer one apportionment rule to another, in light of this double duty. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Political Science Association.},

But when the vote is not evenly divided, even the determination of which party is disfavored becomes controversial. This article examines the ideal fair outcome in a two party single member district system when the statewide vote is not equally divided. It is shown that equal voter empowerment, implied by readings of the First Amendment (Shapiro v. McManus and Whitford v. Nichol), requires that the fraction of seats be proportional to the fraction of the statewide vote. However, strict proportionality conflicts with the single member district system, so alternative approaches are explored. Generalized party inefficiency and voter effectiveness are defined and shown to encompass many possibilities for an ideal fair seats-votes function. The best choice is fundamentally determined by the degree of geographical heterogeneity of voters of like mind. Based upon historical election results, it appears...},

Existing research is mixed, likely because of issues of selection and omitted variables. We address these issues by studying southern US states with runoff primaries-second-round elections that, when triggered, create more divisive primaries. Using a regression discontinuity design, we estimate that a runoff decreases the party's general-election vote share in the House and Senate by approximately 6 percentage points and decreases the party's win probability by approximately 21 percentage points, on average. Opposing results in southern state legislatures suggest that divisive primaries are damaging when salience is high but beneficial when it is low, a pattern we speculate is driven by the competing effects of information in high-versus low-salience primaries.},

abstract = {The standard model of collective choice looks at aggregation procedures which take individual preferences as existing for a specified set of alternatives. In this paper we propose that actors also have preferences for rules of choice or characteristics of choice processes (e.g., the perceived fairness of procedures or the popularity of outcomes) rather than simply for alternatives (outcomes) themselves. We argue that the positing of the existence of meta-preferences can illuminate a number of areas of choice theory. Here we focus on one such area: the problem of "too much" stability in majority rule decision making-a stability which belies the standard theoretical results on the generic instability of majority rule processes. We also show that discussion of the prevalence of stability in collective decision making needs to be clarified because there are at least six distinct types of stability which are sometimes confounded in the literature.},

We develop a theoretical framework that encompasses the major extant models, formalizing the tradeoff between concerns about the location of the new median justice versus concerns about the ideology of the nominee herself. We then use advances in measurement and scaling to place presidents, senators, justices, and nominees on the same scale, allowing us to test predictions that hold across all model variants. We find very little support for MTM theory. Senators have been much more accommodating of the president's nominees than MTM theory would suggest - many have been confirmed when the theory predicted they should have been rejected. These errors have been consequential: presidents have selected many nominees who are much more extreme than MTM theory would predict. These results raise serious questions about the adequacy of MTM theory for explaining confirmation politics and have important implications for assessing the ideological composition of the Court.},

Drawing on an original dataset classifying state level tobacco and vaccine related bill introductions from 1990-2010, we explore factors that determine the generation of state-level public health policy alternatives. We specifically evaluate how the diversity of state interest group populations, the professionalism of state governments, and the ideological polarization of legislatures influence the range of policy alternatives state governments consider in response to emerging public health problems. We find that gridlock caused by ideological polarization and interest group competition has a chilling effect on the specification of policy alternatives, as both interest group diversity and legislative polarization are associated with a decrease in the diversity of laws considered in a state legislative session. Conversely, we find that states with professional legislatures consider a more diverse set of policy alternatives than their peers.},

This trend is largely explained by the clarity of party differences reducing indecision and ambivalence and increasing reliability in presidential voting. American National Election Studies (ANES) Times Series study data show that recent independent, less engaged voters perceive candidate differences as clearly as partisan, engaged voters of past elections and with declining rates of ambivalence, being undecided, and floating. Analysis of ANES inter-election panel studies shows the decline in switching is present among nonvoters too, as pure independents are as reliable in their party support as strong partisans of prior eras. These findings show parties benefit from the behavioral response of all Americans to polarization. By providing an ideological anchor to candidate evaluations, polarization produces a reliable base of party support that is less responsive to short-term forces.},

We conduct laboratory and online experiments to tease out the heuristics subjects use in their responsibility attribution for collective decision makers. The lab experiments comprise a collective dictator game in which decision makers have weighted votes and recipients can punish individual decision makers. Our results show that recipients punish unfair allocations and mainly target the decision maker with proposal power and with the largest vote share. We find weak evidence that decision makers with veto power are targeted or that recipients punish proportional to vote share. The online experiment demonstrates that subjects indeed believe that the decision maker with proposal power has the most influence on the collective decision outcome.

Combining these records with detailed information about 3,000 recent congressional primary and general election candidates, I find that minority turnout is not higher in districts with minority candidates, after accounting for the relative size of the ethnic group within a district. Instead, Black and Latino citizens are more likely to vote in both primary and general elections as their share of the population increases, regardless of candidate race.},

Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustratite the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends have. The logic underlying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement fo friendships in a social network. This disproportionate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experience beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are.},

The analysis shows that the use of single-member districts is associated with higher levels of malapportionment in lower chambers and that federalism and country size account for variation in malapportionment in upper chambers. Furthermore, African and especially Latin American countries tend to have electoral systems that are highly malapportioned. The article concludes by proposing a broad, comparative research agenda that focuses on the origins, evolution and consequences of malapportionment.},

abstract = {Local elites are thought to influence how other individuals vote in many new democracies. The existing literature suggests the influence of these leaders undermines the voting process by causing voters to support candidates for reasons tangential to political performance. However, voters who support candidates preferred by local patrons may be making sophisticated political inferences. In many developing countries, access to government-provided local public goods is mediated by local patrons, who are better able to deliver resources if they have strong relationships with elected politicians. This argument is tested using data from an original survey of traditional chiefs and an experiment involving voters in Zambia. Chiefs and politicians with stronger relationships collaborate more effectively to provide local public goods. Furthermore, voters are particularly likely to vote with their chief if they perceive the importance of chiefs and politicians working jointly for local development.},

Using an Internet-based, national opinion survey in conjunction with legislator voting records from the 109th and 110th Congresses, we show that members of Congress are more extreme than their constituents, i.e., that there is a lack of congruence between American voters and members of Congress. We also show that when a congressional legislator is replaced by a new member of the opposite party, one relative extremist is replaced by an opposing extremist. We call this leapfrog representation, a form of representation that leaves moderates with a dearth of representation in Congress. We see evidence of leapfrog representation in states and House districts and in the aggregate as well: the median member of the 109th House was too conservative compared to the median American voter, yet the median of the 110th House was too liberal. Thus, the median American voter was leapfrogged when the 109th House transitioned to the 110th. Although turnover between the 109th and 110th Senates occurred at approximately the same rate as between the 109th and 110th Houses, the Senate appears to be a more moderate institution whose median member does not move as abruptly as that of the House.},

abstract = {We report results from a laboratory experiment testing the basic hypothesis embedded in various rational voter models that there is a direct correlation between the strength of an individual's belief that his or her vote will be pivotal and the likelihood that individual incurs the cost to vote. This belief is typically unobservable. In one of our experimental treatments we elicit these subjective beliefs using a proper scoring rule that induces truthful revelation of beliefs. This allows us to directly test the pivotal voter model. We find that a higher subjective probability of being pivotal increases the likelihood that an individual votes, but the probability thresholds used by subjects are not as crisp as the theory would predict. There is some evidence that individuals learn over time to adjust their beliefs to be more consistent with the historical frequency of pivotality. However, many subjects keep substantially overestimating their probability of being pivotal.},

abstract = {This article explores the diffusion of criminal justice policy in the American states. Drawing on policy design theory, I code newspaper coverage of 44 criminal justice policies adopted across state governments from 1960-2008, identifying the image and power of target populations-the group singled out for special treatment under law. I test whether electoral pressure leads governments to disproportionally emulate innovations that reinforce popular stereotypes regarding who is entitled to policy benefits or deserving of policy burdens. I find strong support for this theory: State governments are more likely to adopt innovations that extend benefits to strong, popular, and powerful target populations or that impose burdens on weak and politically marginalized groups. This bias can be explained by pressures for responsive policy making, as my findings indicate that it is the national salience of the crime problem-but not the competitiveness or timing of state elections-that influences state adoption of popular "law and order" policy innovations.},

Our research tests several rival theories of protest activity for citizens across an exceptionally wide range of polities. With data from the 1999–2002 wave of the World Values Survey, we demonstrate that the macro-level context – levels of economic and political development – significantly influences the amount of popular protest. Furthermore, a multi-level model examines how national context interacts with the micro-level predictors of protest activity. The findings indicate that contemporary protest is expanding not because of increasing dissatisfaction with government, but because economic and political development provide the resources for those who have political demands.},

abstract = {The concept of electoral competition plays a central role in many subfields of political science, but no consensus exists on how to measure it. One key challenge is how to conceptualize and measure electoral competitiveness at the district level across alternative electoral systems. Recent eeorts to meet this challenge have introduced general measures of competitiveness which rest on explicit calculations about how votes translate into seats, but also implicit assumptions about how eeort maps into votes (and how costly eeort is). We investigate how assumptions about the eeort-to-votes mapping aaect the units in which competitiveness is best measured, arguing in favor of vote-share-denominated measures and against vote-share-per-seat measures. Whether elections under multimember proportional representation systems are judged more or less competitive than single-member plurality or runoo elections depends directly on the units in which competitiveness is assessed (and hence on assumptions about how eeort maps into votes).},

In a research field dominated by empirical studies - such as the one on voter turnout - an overview of where we stand and what we know is not superfluous. Therefore, the present paper reviews and assesses the empirical evidence brought forward through a meta-analysis of 83 aggregate-level studies. We thereby concentrate on the effect of socio-economic, political and institutional variables. The results argue for the introduction of a 'core' model of voter turnout - including, among other elements, population size and election closeness - that can be used as a starting point for extending our knowledge on why people vote. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that at least two distinct components of shape--dispersion and perimeter length--are necessary elements of any reasonable compactness measure and that compactness may be based on geography or on population. An appropriate strategy, therefore, is simultaneously to consider multiple measures that collectively define compactness. We identify and evaluate multiple operationalizations and compare them both theoretically and empirically. Data from five states provide abundant evidence that the major types of measures sometimes vary widely in their evaluation of the compactness of a given district. There is some support, however, for the hypothesis that multiple measures yield similar assessments of districting plans. We conclude with a discussion of how compactness might be used in legislative districting.},

While some scholars argue that an electorate of well-informed voters is necessary for the production of responsive electoral outcomes, others argue that apparently ignorant voters will suffice because they can adapt their behavior to the complexity of electoral choice. To evaluate the validity of these arguments, I develop and analyze a survey of California voters who faced five complicated insurance reform ballot initiatives. I find that access to a particular class of widely available information shortcuts allowed badly informed voters to emulate the behavior of relatively well informed voters. This finding is suggestive of the conditions under which voters who lack encyclopedic information about the content of electoral debates can nevertheless use information shortcuts to vote as though they were well informed.},

@article{King2000e,
abstract = {I am grateful for such thoughtful review from these three distinguished geographers. Fotheringham provides an excellent summary of the approach offered, including how it combines the two methods that have dominated applications (and methodological analysis) for nearly half a century– the method of bounds (Duncan and Davis, 1953) and Goodman's (1953) least squares regression. Since Goodman's regression is the only method of ecological inference "widely used in Geography" (O'Loughlin), adding information that is known to be true from the method of bounds (for each observation) would seem to have the chance to improve a lot of research in this field. The other addition that EI provides is estimates at the lowest level of geography available, making it possible to map results, instead of giving only single summary numbers for the entire geographic region. Whether one considers the combined method offered "the" solution (as some reviewers and commentators have portrayed it), "a" solution (as I tried to describe it), or, perhaps better and more simply, as an improved method of ecological inference, is not importatnt. The point is that more data are better, and this method incorporates more. I am gratified that all three reviewers seem to support these basic points. In this response, I clarify a few points, correct some misunderstandings, and present additional evidence. I conclude with some possible directions for future research.},

Much of the controversy has stemmed over the possibility that the college has the potential to produce a so-called "wrong winner"--that is a President who has not won the national popular vote. When this happened for the fourth time in the 2000 presidential election, opponents of the college created a plan to avoid the cumbersome constitutional amendment process and end the electoral college through an interstate compact that would ensure that the winner of the national popular vote would become President. This Note argues that this plan, while certainly clever, may run afoul of another deeply contested area of law--sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act--as either minority vote dilution or retrogression in the ability of minority voters to elect the candidate of their choice. In addition, state-based efforts to abolish the electoral college can also be used for partisan manipulation. Accordingly, the Note concludes that the electoral college should only be abolished through a constitutional amendment.},

abstract = {Different institutions can produce more (or less) preferred outcomes, in terms of citizens' preferences. Consequently, citizen preferences over institutions may "inherit"-to use William Riker's term-the features of preferences over outcomes. But the level of information and understanding required for this effect to be observable seems quite high. In this paper, we investigate whether Riker's intuition about citizens acting on institutional preferences is borne out by an original empirical dataset collected for this purpose. These data, a survey commissioned specifically for this project, were collected as part of a larger nationally representative sample conducted right before the 2004 election. The results show that support for a reform to split a state's Electoral College votes proportionally is explained by (1) which candidate one supports, (2) which candidate one thinks is likely to win the election under the existing system of apportionment, (3) preferences for abolishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote winner, and (4) statistical interactions between these variables. In baldly political terms, Kerry voters tend to support splitting their state's Electoral College votes if they felt George W. Bush was likely to win in that state. But Kerry voters who expect Kerry to win their state favor winner-take-all Electoral College rules for their state. In both cases, mutatis mutandis, the reverse is true for Bush voters. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Existing empirical research finds that female candidates have higher levels of qualifications for political office compared to male candidates. An untested assumption behind this finding is that female candidates must have stronger qualifications to overcome feminine stereotypes that characterize women as ill qualified for leadership positions. I test this assumption by drawing on psychology research to develop a theory that explains how a candidate's sex affects the way voters evaluate the qualifications of political candidates. Using innovative survey experiments, the results show that, across multiple experiments, voters hold female candidates, relative to male candidates, to more stringent qualification standards, and these higher standards limit the ability of female candidates to secure electoral support. These findings uncover a subtle but pernicious source of bias facing female candidates. The implications speak to how candidate sex affects voter decision-making and the ability of democratic institutions to select the best candidates for leadership.},

First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child's income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4{\%} in Charlotte but 12.9{\%} in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.},

We analyse the trade-off between coordination and learning about candidate quality under different temporal election systems in the context of the U.S. presidential primary system. In our model, candidates with different policy positions and qualities compete for the nomination, and voters are uncertain about the candidates' valence. This setup generates two effects: vote splitting (i.e. several candidates in the same policy position compete for the same voter pool) and voter learning (as the results in earlier elections help voters to update their beliefs on candidate quality). Sequential voting minimizes vote splitting in late districts, but voters may coordinate on a low-quality candidate. Using the parameter estimates obtained from all the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries during 2000-12, we conduct policy experiments such as replacing the current system with a simultaneous system, adopting the reform proposal of the National Association of Secretaries of State, or imposing party rules that lead to candidate withdrawal when prespecified conditions are met.},

We examine Latino voting in the 2018 midterm election using both aggregate election data from 2014 and 2018 as well as a large 10-week tracking poll (n=2767) of Latinos during the last 2 months of the 2018 election. We show that, compared to 2014, the number of ballots cast by Latinos increased substantially. Using the tracking poll, however, we show that threat alone did not appear to be sufficient to mobilize Latino voters in the 2018 election. It is threat combined with mobilization, rather, that increased Latino voting. We discuss implications for future Latino political participation in the US.},

We develop a general statistical model of the relationship between votes and seats and separate these two important concepts theoretically and empirically. In so doing, we also solve several methodological problems with the study of seats, votes, and the cube law. An application to U.S. congressional districts provides estimates of bias and representation for each state and demonstrates the model's utility. Results of this application show distinct types of representation coexisting in U. S. states. Although most states have small partisan biases, there are some with a substantial degree of bias.},

Residents of recreational counties tend to be more liberal than their rural peers on a variety of political issues, and supported Barack Obama at significantly higher levels in 2008 and 2012. In contrast, in regions dominated by the old rural economy of farming, political views are more conservative and there is far less support for Democrats in general and President Obama in particular.

Using data on candidate trips as well as estimates of the time candidates spend in states, we conclude, first, that much of the apparent empirical support for Brams and Davis's 3/2's hypothesis is an artifact of the candidates' consideration of each state's relative competitiveness and the statistical relationship between size and competitiveness. There is some evidence, however, for a residual bias. That is, after controlling for each state's competitiveness, campaign allocations still appear to favor larger states—at least for the two competitive elections of 1960 and 1968. We attribute that bias to corner solutions to the candidate's maximization problem and to the effects of sequential campaign planning. Thus, while we do not dispute the existence of bias over the course of the entire campaign, the data are consistent with a modified (albeit complex) proportional rule that each candidate applies sequentially during the campaign. Our conclusion is that the unit rule feature of the Electoral College, rather than weighted voting, is the predominant cause of bias.},

abstract = {Objectives: We offer a typology of possible reforms to the Electoral College (EC) in terms of changes to its two most important structural features: seat allocations that are not directly proportional to population and winner-take-all outcomes at the state level. This typology allows us to classify four major variants of “reform” to the present EC in a parsimonious fashion. Many of the proposals we consider have been suggested by well-known figures, some debated in Congress, and they include what we view as most likely to be taken seriously. We evaluate these proposals solely in terms of one simple criterion: “Would they be expected to reduce the likelihood of inversions between EC and popular vote outcomes?”. Methods: We answer this question by looking at the data on actual presidential election outcomes at the state level over the entire period 1868–2016, and at the congressional-district level over the period 1956–2016. We consider the implications for presidential outcomes of these different alternative mechanisms, in comparison to the actual electoral outcome and the popular vote outcome. In addition, we consider the implications of a proposal to increase the size of the U.S. House (Ladewig and Jasinski, 2008). Results: Our results show that inversions from the popular vote happen under all proposed alternatives at nearly the same rate as under the current EC rules, with some proposals actually making inversions more frequent. Conclusions: The major difference between the present EC rule and alternative rules is not in frequency of inversions, but is in which particular years the inversions occur. As for the proposal to increase the size of the House, we show that any realistic increase in House size would have made no difference for the 2016 outcome.},

abstract = {Violent protests are dramatic political events, yet we know little about the effect of these events on political behavior. While scholars typically treat violent protests as deliberate acts undertaken in pursuit of specific goals, due to a lack of appropriate data and difficulty in causal identification, there is scant evidence of whether riots can actually increase support for these goals. Using geocoded data, we analyze measures of policy support before and after the 1992 Los Angeles riot—one of the most high-profile events of political violence in recent American history—that occurred just prior to an election. Contrary to some expectations from the academic literature and the popular press, we find that the riot caused a marked liberal shift in policy support at the polls. Investigating the sources of this shift, we find that it was likely the result of increased mobilization of both African American and white voters. Remarkably, this mobilization endures over a decade later.},

abstract = {We study the sources of racial and ethnic disparities in income using de-identified longitudinal data covering nearly the entire U.S. population from 1989-2015. We document three sets of results. First, the intergenerational persistence of disparities varies substantially across racial groups. For example, Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations. Conditional on parent income, the black-white income gap is driven entirely by large differences in wages and employment rates between black and white men; there are no such differences between black and white women. Second, differences in family characteristics such as parental marital status, education, and wealth explain very little of the black-white income gap conditional on parent income. Differences in ability also do not explain the patterns of intergenerational mobility we document. Third, the black-white gap persists even among boys who grow up in the same neighborhood. Controlling for parental income, black boys have lower incomes in adulthood than white boys in 99{\%} of Census tracts. Both black and white boys have better outcomes in low-poverty areas, but black-white gaps are larger on average for boys who grow up in such neighborhoods. The few areas in which black-white gaps are relatively small tend to be low-poverty neighborhoods with low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among blacks. Black males who move to such neighborhoods earlier in childhood earn more and are less likely to be incarcerated. However, fewer than 5{\%} of black children grow up in such environments. These findings suggest that reducing the black-white income gap will require efforts whose impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.},

Though studies argue it influences how communities are represented through constituency service, they are limited since legislators' service activities are unobserved. Using Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, we collected 88,000 records of communication between members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies during the 108th–113th Congresses. These legislative interventions allow us to examine members' “follow-through” with policy implementation. We find that women, racial/ethnic minorities, and veterans are more likely to work on behalf of constituents with whom they share identities. Including veterans offers leverage in understanding the role of political cleavages and shared experiences. Our findings suggest that shared experiences operate as a critical mechanism for representation, that a lack of political consensus is not necessary for substantive representation, and that the causal relationships identified by experimental work have observable implications in the daily work of Congress.},

Our analysis is more complete and representative of true forms of spatial autocorrelation and pays particular attention to the specification of spatial autocorrelation in models with random coefficient variation. Our assessment focuses on the effects of this specification on the bias and precision of parameter estimates.},

abstract = {American Presidential elections are indirect, reflecting popular support for the candidates through the institution of the Electoral College to choose the President. In common with other plurality-based electoral systems, the College tends to exaggerate the apparent mandate received by the winner of the popular vote but, on occasion, can deliver victory to the second-placed candidate. Despite a sizeable literature on its operation and vagaries, however, relatively little attention has been paid to the question of systematic bias in the College: does one party receive a consistent advantage over the other from the College's operation? The paper examines the evidence for such a bias in each Presidential election since 1960. Although biases have occurred and in some cases were substantial, neither major party is a consistent beneficiary; the prime source of bias is to be found in the relative effectiveness of parties' own vote-winning strategies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

These areas include the study of race, representation, and bias in legislatures and courts; and policy responsiveness and legislative accountability. I synthesize this research by examining puzzles that emerge between the field experimental and observational work. I conclude with suggestions for promising research avenues , including the use of field experiments to study the bureaucracy.

In this article, I demonstrate that this assumption does not hold for partisan redistricting analysis because partisan blocs of voters are not durable. Instead, their partisan profile changes in response to incumbency, electoral competition and redistricting. These findings not only contradict prevailing analyses of redistricting, but also undermine the logic of remedial redistricting.},

We also provide conditions under which it is possible to construct a structurally stable core. If there are only a few dimensions, our results demonstrate the stability properties of such frequently used rules as two-thirds and three-fourths.

Owing to the rapid expansion of political activities in the last decades this question has become increasingly dif fi cult to answer. Neither the development of all-embracing nominal de fi ni- tions, nor deductive analyses of existing modes of participation seem to be helpful. In addition, the spread of expressive modes of participation makes it hard to avoid purely subjective de fi nitions. The aim of this discussion paper is to develop an operational de fi ni- tion of political participation, which allows us to cover distinct conceptualizations system- atically, ef fi ciently and consistently. This goal can only be arrived at if the conventional approach of presenting nominal de fi nitions to solve conceptual problems is left behind. Instead, available de fi nitions are included in a set of decision rules to distinguish three main variants of political participation. A fourth variant is distinguished for non-political activ- ities used for political purposes. Together, the four variants of political participation cover the whole range of political participation systematically without excluding any mode of political participation unknown yet. At the same time, the endless expansion of the modes of political participation in modern democracies does not result in an endless conceptual expansion. Implications for research and various examples are discussed},

abstract = {[In the summer of 2006, Congress reauthorized the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) with a unanimous vote in the Senate and with limited opposition in the House of Representatives. The veneer of bipartisanship that outsiders perceived in the final vote glossed over serious disagreements between the parties over the meaning of the central provision of the new VRA, which prohibits voting laws that "diminish the ability" of minority citizens "to elect their preferred candidates of choice." Those disagreements came to the surface in a fractured Senate Committee Report released only after Congress had passed the law. This Article describes the unprecedented legislative history of this law, and the political and constitutional constraints that led the law to take the form that it did. It also presents an interpretation of the new retrogression standard that avoids the partisan bias of alternatives while emphasizing the importance of racially polarized voting to the constitutionality and meaning of this new law. It urges that the new law be read as preventing redistricting plans that reduce the aggregated probability across districts of the election of candidates preferred by the minority community and disfavored by whites.]},

abstract = {This article advances the argument that the effects of demographic change on individual-level immigration policy preferences is dependent on the level of segregation in the individuals' local context. Increases in the immigrant population in highly segregated counties should increase opposition to immigration because opportunities for contact and exposure are missing and group differences are emphasized. Meanwhile, population increases in more integrated counties should lead to an alleviation of interethnic tensions due to more frequent opportunities for contact. Furthermore, whites may react differently to changes in racial/ethnic composition of a local context depending on the particular group moving into the area because some groups are closer to fulfilling Allport's equal status contact condition than others. The empirical analysis finds strong support for the first assertion that population growth of Latina/os and Asian Americans in highly segregated areas results in support for restrictive immigrati...},

abstract = {In League of Women Voters et al. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania et al. (2018), henceforth abbreviated LWV, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down that state's congressional plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of LWV for future partisan gerrymandering litigation. In particular, we look toward the applicability of the Pennsylvania court's approach to other potential partisan gerrymandering challenges brought under state law, especially those in the 12 states whose state constitutions have provisions essentially identical to the one relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in states with similar provisions. We pay particular attention to how the court made use of the expert witness testimony in the case, relying on some of it, while rejecting or critiquing the applicability of other elements, since such a discussion can inform future litigation in state courts drawing on the LWV opinion for ideas. In our concluding discussion we contrast the criteria used to evaluate partisan gerrymandering by this court with those used by federal courts, and we look at how it may impact the decisions of legislators about line drawing in 2020.},

It argues that the possibility of holding a second round of voting is a destabilizing factor that inhibits democratic development and encourages the use of nonelectoral means of exercising power. This is because the institution of the double ballot works to fragment the party system by establishing district-specific strategic incentives and by diminishing the element of uncertainty that is key to securing cooperation by important political actors. This proposition is tested on a data set of all states that as of 1 January 1999 held elections to the lower houses of their national assemblies, as well as on a smaller database of democratizing countries.},

@article{Elmendorf2018,
abstract = {For decades, legal attacks on partisan gerrymanders have found- ered on a manageability dilemma: doctrinal standards the Supreme Court has regarded as judicially discoverable have been rejected as unmanageable, whereas the more manageable standards on offer have been dismissed as insufficiently tethered to the Constitu- tion—that is, as undiscoverable. This Article contends that a solution to the dilemma may be found in a seemingly unlikely place: the body of state constitutional law concerned with the adequacy of state systems of public education. The justiciability barriers to partisan gerrymandering claims have near analogues in educational ade- quacy cases, yet only a minority of the state courts have deemed educational adequacy claims nonjusticiable. Other courts have dealt with putatively standardless education claims by holding that the legislature must adopt educational standards, together with a system of testing, school finance, and accountability reasonably designed to realize those standards. If the legislature drags its feet, courts have issued provisional remedies, which the legislature is free to update or replace. I explain how the same strategy could be adapted for a new generation of “representational adequacy” claims under broadly worded provisions found in many state constitutions. I also suggest that by anchoring claims to the generally worded provisions about representation found in state constitutions (or possibly Article I of the U.S. Constitution), litigants could mitigate the downside risk of success under the Equal Protection Clause—namely, the inducement of responsiveness-dampening bipartisan gerrymanders. The Online Appendix provides a state-by-state breakdown of constitutional provisions and relevant precedents, highlighting twenty-two states that appear ripe for representational adequacy litigation.},

abstract = {Do attitudes of elected officials toward racial issues change when the issues are portrayed as economic? Traditionally, scholars have presented Confederate symbols as primarily a racial issue: elites supporting their eradication from public life tend to emphasize the association of Confederate symbols with slavery and institutionalized racism, while those elected officials who oppose the removal of Confederate symbols often cite the heritage of white southerners. In addition to these racial explanations, we argue that there is an economic component underlying support for removal of Confederate symbols among political elites. Racial issues can also be economic issues, and framing a racial issue as an economic issue can change elite attitudes. In the case of removal of Confederate symbols, the presence of such imagery is considered harmful to business. Two survey experiments of elected officials in eleven U.S. southern states show that framing the decision to remove Confederate symbols as good for business causes those elected officials to favor removing the Confederate flag from public spaces. Elected officials can be susceptible to framing, just like regular citizens.},

Such a focus, however, omits a key point: electoral rules also distribute power among geographic units. If, within a party, the partisan and geographic interests of some members conflict, then the canonical relationship between partisanship and rule choice may be conditional. The U.S. electoral college provides an opportunity to test for such intra-party variation, because it advantages some states over others and thus makes salient geographic allegiances. Using an original dataset on one reform proposal—the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (NPVIC)—I find evidence of competing loyalties. Although NPVIC advances furthest when Democrats control state lawmaking, a state's status as a swing—but not as an overrepresented—state weakens the relationship to the point where even Democrats are unlikely to aid NPVIC.},

abstract = {AIM To review the experience of paediatric ovarian masses at Starship Children's Hospital (Auckland, New Zealand). Primarily to assess the range of pathology, the presenting features, and the surgical management of these lesions. METHODS A search of the hospital surgical pathology database was carried out to identify patients less than 16 years in whom ovarian tissue was submitted for pathological analysis during the 12 year period from January 2000 to December 2011. A retrospective review of the medical records was carried out. RESULTS 244 ovarian masses in 219 patients were identified. 99 of these were neoplastic with 19 (7.8{\%}) being malignant and an additional four (1.6{\%}) borderline malignant lesions (borderline epithelial tumours). Mature cystic teratoma was the commonest neoplastic lesion (55.6{\%}). Patients who presented with acute abdominal pain were more commonly found to have non-neoplastic lesions than neoplastic lesions (71.5{\%} vs 46.9{\%}, p{\textless}0.0001), and those that presented with a palpable mass were more commonly found to have a neoplastic lesion (24.0{\%} vs 3.3{\%}, p{\textless}0.0001). Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 41.6{\%} of all patients. Ovary conserving surgery was performed in 56.6{\%} of all patients, though only 32.3{\%} of patients with neoplastic lesions. CONCLUSION This study provides important insight into the range of ovarian pathology encountered in a New Zealand paediatric population. Most of the ovarian lesions in paediatric age groups are benign. Ovarian sparing surgery is recommended. In cases of ovarian torsion, malignancy in this series and in the literature is less than 2{\%}. This review highlights that paediatric surgical units have vast experience to deal with ovarian pathology in paediatric age groups.},

This article explores this “pseudoparadox,” and argues that the answer can be found in partisan redistricting. Through an analysis of 40 years of congressional elections, I find that partisan gerrymanders induce greater competitiveness as national tides increase, largely due to unanticipated consequences of waves adverse to the map-drawing party, particularly in seats held by that party. The phenomenon anecdotally coined by Grofman and Brunell as the “dummymander” is thus actually quite common and has significant effects on rates of congressional competition nationally. In contrast, bipartisan maps are shown to induce lower competition, while nonpartisan maps induce higher competition, under all electoral conditions and competitiveness measures. But the effects of partisan gerrymanders on competition, though strong, can only be seen in interaction with short-term national forces.},

This article explains the bias in terms of information asymmetries and the free-rider problem. First, incumbents increase their reelection prospects by biasing policy toward groups that are better able to monitor their activities. Second, because smaller groups are better able to overcome the free-rider problem of costly monitoring, policy will be biased in their favor. Third, the effect of asymmetric monitoring on voter welfare is ambiguous. The inefficiencies created by the policy bias are offset by a positively valued selection bias: Incumbents of above-average quality are more likely to survive voter scrutiny than are low-quality types.},

Bishop argued this has increased as the result of residential location decisions: Democratic Party supporters have increasingly moved to neighborhoods where others of that persuasion are already congregated, for example. His analyses at the county scale are geographically incommensurate with that argument, however; the lacuna is filled using precinct-level data for the entire United States for the 2008, 2012 and 2016 presidential elections. Multi-level modelling shows polarization at those elections was significantly greater at the precinct than the county, state and division scales. Change over the three elections at the precinct scale was probably associated with redistricting and reduced support from the Democratic Party by some groups.},

The psychology of intergroup relations identifies empathy as one of the key mechanisms that reduces intergroup conflict, and some have suggested that a lack of empathy has contributed to partisan polarization. Yet, empathy may not always live up to this promise. We argue that, in practice, the experience of empathy is biased toward one's ingroup and can actually exacerbate political polarization. First, using a large, national sample, we demonstrate that higher levels of dispositional empathic concern are associated with higher levels of affective polarization. Second, using an experimental design, we show that individuals high in empathic concern show greater partisan bias in evaluating contentious political events. Taken together, our results suggest that, contrary to popular views, higher levels of dispositional empathy actually facilitate partisan polarization.},

The extant literature is unclear on the question, with some studies pointing to evidence in the affirmative, but others indicating these effects may be null. We draw on the literature on role model effects in psychology to argue that an individual's feelings about a particular candidate may affect whether or not that candidate is actually able to inspire that individual to run herself. Using campaign ads from Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for the U.S. presidency, we find evidence that observing Clinton running for office does indeed increase the political ambition of some of her women supporters. At the same time, though, observing her run actually decreases ambition in other women. This effect is much greater than the effect of the context of the political ad, which does not seem to have a significant effect on women's political ambition. Furthermore, because observing Clinton also decreases the ambition of her male ...},

Recent work by Valentino and Neuner (2017) suggests that the disconnect between the predictions of rational choice models of voter turnout that focus on the costs of voting and the observed effects (or lack thereof) of voter ID requirements can be explained with reference to the countervailing influence of mobilization efforts on the part of Democrats. We test this proposition directly in this article using data on the location of Democratic campaign field offices over three presidential election cycles (2004, 2008, and 2012) coupled with information on the spread of voter ID requirements and other policies regulating access to the ballot box. Using a series of difference-in-difference models, we find some support for the notion that campaigns can effectively subsidize the costs of new legal-institutional barriers to the franchise.},

In addition to offering a new approach to measuring durable change in national party dominance, and providing a non-parametric criterion to identify unusual changes in seat/vote shares, we provide fresh insights via a unifying statistical approach that reflects both of these factors simultaneously. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of critical election determinations in two ways. First, we compare the magnitude of inter-election shifts with both average volatility over the entire time period and volatility relative to a particular time period. Second, as an alternative to the usual perspective, we consider critical elections not as a one-time cataclysm, but rather as a pair (or perhaps even triple) of consecutive substantial shifts, generated by the same underlying factors. Overall, we distinguish six elections that marginally or provisionally meet our criteria to be critical elections. But focusing on pairs of elections, 1858-60 and 1930-32 stand out as critical among all elections since the 1850s.},

Based on the assumption that the threat of revolution is directly related to the number of people that may attempt to revolt, the theory predicts that the stylized fact initially uncovered by the paper can be refined as follows: there is a negative relationship between population size, and its geographical concentration, and post-tax inequality in non-democracies. We subject these predictions to extensive empirical scrutiny in a cross-country context, and the data robustly confirm these patterns of inequality, population, and the interaction with democracy.},

abstract = {Although turmoil characterized both the Middle East and East Asia in the two decades following World War II, the two regions looked dramatically different at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Since 1965 the incidence of interstate wars and militarized conflicts has been nearly five times higher in the Middle East, as was their severity, including the use of ballistic missiles and chemical weapons. By contrast, declining militarized conflict and rising intraregional cooperation has replaced earlier patterns in East Asia. There are no systematic efforts explaining this contrast between Bella Levantina and an evolving Pax Asiatica. This article traces these diverging paths to competing domestic models of political survival. East Asian leaders pivoted their political control on economic performance and integration in the global economy, whereas Middle East leaders relied on inward-looking self-sufficiency, state and military entrepreneurship, and a related brand of nationalism. I examine permissive and catalytic conditions explaining the models' emergence; their respective intended and unintended effects on states, military, and authoritarian institutions; and their implications for regional conflict.

We consider measures that, rather than examining the shapes of districts, utilize only the partisan vote distribution among districts. The measures considered are two versions of partisan bias, the efficiency gap and several of its variants, the mean-median difference and the equal vote weight standard, the declination and one variant, and the lopsided-means test. Our primary means of evaluating these measures is a suite of hypothetical elections we classify from the start as fair or unfair. We conclude that the declination is the most successful measure in terms of avoiding false positives and false negatives on the elections considered. We include in a supplementary appendix the most extreme outliers for each measure among historical congressional and state legislative elections.},

We are particularly interested in the extent to which anti-politics attitudes, nativist attitudes, and social issue attitudes structured the way voters perceived the candidates. Methods: Using principal components analysis of feeling thermometer ratings of presidential candidates in the 2016 general election, we are able to identify two major dimensions structuring voters' perceptions of political figures. Results: Data from national surveys suggest that anti-politics attitudes were prevalent in 2016, but that the major party candidates were only marginally effective at tapping into this sentiment. Conclusion: Relative to other Republican presidential candidates, Trump was more effective in tapping into anti-political feelings prior to the Republican Convention. By the general election, issue perceptions of Trump were similar to those we see for most Republican presidential candidates. Feelings toward third-party candidates, however, were more strongly structured by an anti-politics dimension.},

abstract = {We take as our starting point the insights of Downs (1957) into two-party competition. A careful reading of Downs offers a much more sophisticated and nuanced portrait of the factors affecting party differentiation than the simplistic notion that, in plurality elections, we ought to expect party convergence to the views of the median voter. Later scholars have built on Downsian ideas to see what happens vis-{\`{a}}-vis party differentiation when we modify key assumptions found in the basic Downsian spatial model. Recent work allows us to turn what is taken to be the Downsian view on its head: Although there are pressures in two-party competition for the two parties to converge, in general we should expect nonconvergence. Moreover, contra the negative portrait offered by Green {\&} Shapiro (1994) of the limited or nonexistent value of research on party competition models in the Downsian tradition, we argue that, when viewed as a whole, neo-Downsian models - especially those of the past decade - do allow us to reconcile theory and data in terms of a multi-componented theory of party competition with testable implications for comparative statics.},

Even if legislators do not con- verge perfectly to the preferences of their constituents, do they converge more when voting on bills of particular interest to their districts? We combine roll-call votes, sub- stantive information about bills, electoral returns, and information on the economic and demographic characteristics of districts to test whether legislators cater their roll-call behavior to the priorities of their constituents. Using a series of difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity designs, we estimate the extent to which Republican and Democratic members of Congress differentially represent the same set of constituents on eight narrow issue areas, and we test whether this “party representation gap” shrinks for districts with strong interests in those issues. We find no evidence that legislators converge to their districts' preferences, even on the most locally salient bills.},

We hope to set efforts to measure “place” for the study of context and politics on firmer footing. Our validity assessments show that individuals are thinking about people and places with which they have regular contact when asked to draw their communities. Our reliability assessments show that people can draw more or less the same map twice, even when the exercise is repeated months later. Finally, we provide evidence that the concept of community is a tangible consideration in the minds of ordinary citizens and is not simply a normative aspiration or motivation.},

abstract = {Over the past century, the size and reach of American state governments has increased dramatically, altering the balance of power across state capitols. Although state legislatures were historically privileged as "firsts among equals," modern administrative reforms have transformed state governments from legislative-centric to executive-dominated systems. In many states, part-time citizen legislatures now operate alongside fully professionalized executives. We introduce a new measure capturing the relative professionalism of state legislative and executive branches, allowing us to explore the policy consequences of the rising imbalance of power across states governments. Drawing upon a large panel data set of proposed and adopted state regulations from 1990 through 2010, we demonstrate that the eroding policy expertise of state legislators has resulted in increased bureaucratic participation in the policy process, as amateur politicians rely more heavily on professionalized executive agencies to define problems and develop solutions. Our findings highlight intuitive, yet understudied, consequences of common institutional reforms and speak to recent and recurring debates about the separation of powers and public policymaking. {\textcopyright} The Author 2016.

@article{Martin2018,
abstract = {Political preferences in the United States are highly correlated with population density, at national, state, and metropolitan-area scales. Using new data from voter registration records, we assess the extent to which this pattern can be explained by geographic mobility. We find that the revealed preferences of voters who move from one residence to another correlate with partisan affiliation, though voters appear to be sorting on non-political neighborhood attributes that covary with partisan preferences rather than explicitly seeking politically congruent neighbors. But, critically, we demonstrate through a simulation study that the estimated partisan bias in moving choices is on the order of five times too small to sustain the current geographic polarization of preferences. We conclude that location must have some influence on political preference, rather than the other way around, and provide evidence in support of this theory. Speaking at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama, then a candidate for the US Senate, famously declared that "there's not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America." Obama then went on to decry political pundits who "like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states" (Obama 2004). The implication of Obama's speech was that the perception of geographic polarization of the country into reliably Democratic and Republican areas was not based in fact, but was instead a false narrative imposed by the media. Obama's rhetoric of unity and homogeneity across party lines notwithstanding, there is substantial evidence that cultural and lifestyle preferences correlate strongly with political tastes. If such correlations between political and lifestyle preferences are strong enough, the implication is clear: we should expect to find a geographically polarized electorate of exactly the kind that Obama's speech sought to deny. This pattern is indeed strikingly evident in American voting behavior: locations with higher population density-and associated lifestyle characteristics such as smaller housing units, proximity to cultural amenities, and access to mass transit-have higher proportions of Democratic voters than do locations with lower density-and associated larger homes, more greenery and greater privacy from neighbors (Rodden 2010). What is the causal relationship underlying this robust empirical pattern? Does it emerge, as some scholars have suggested, as a result of "residential sorting:" partisans' choices to preferentially move to neighborhoods with like-minded neighbors (Bishop 2008)? Or might the causal arrow be reversed, with the physical and social environment of one's residential location influencing one's political beliefs? In this paper, we contribute empirical and simulation-based evidence measuring how much of the observed geographic polarization in political preferences can be explained by the former mechanism of selection into politically congruent neighborhoods. We show that residential sorting, on its own, cannot explain a level of geographic polarization anywhere close to that observed in the US today, implying that the latter mechanism must have some empirical power.},

This article develops predictive seat-vote equations for a much wider range of elections, including those involving many parties, single- and multi-seat districts, and diverse seat allocation rules such as plurality and list proportional representation (PR). Without any statistical curve fitting based on the seat and vote shares themselves, the basic features of the conversion are predicted using exogenous parameters: magnitude and number of districts, number of parties, and total size of the electorate and of the assembly. The link between the proposed equations and the original cube law is explicated. Using an existing data base, the fit of the predictive model is examined. On balance, this model accounts well for the conversion of votes to seats, and for the deviation from proportionality in PR systems.},

abstract = {We demonstrate the surprising benefits of legislative redistricting (including partisan gerrymandering) for American representative democracy. In so doing, our analysis resolves two long-standing controversies in American politics. First, whereas some scholars believe that redistricting reduces electoral responsiveness by protecting incumbents, others, that the relationship is spurious, we demonstrate that both sides are wrong: redistricting increases responsiveness. Second, while some researchers believe that gerrymandering dramatically increases partisan bias and others deny this effect, we show both sides are in a sense correct. Gerrymandering biases electoral systems in favor of the party that controls the redistricting as compared to what would have happened if the other party controlled it, but any type of redistricting reduces partisan bias as compared to an electoral system without redistricting. Incorrect conclusions in both literatures resulted from misjudging the enormous uncertainties present during redistricting periods, making simplified assumptions about the redistricters' goals, and using inferior statistical methods.},

Recent formal theory literature has contributed new insights into how parties choose platforms in countries with a continuum of heterogeneous districts. Meanwhile, increases in survey sample sizes and advances in empirical techniques have made it possible to characterize the distribution of preferences within and across electoral districts. This review addresses an emerging literature that builds on these new tools to explore the ways in which the geography of political preferences can help explain the parties that compete, the platforms and policies they choose, and even the rules under which they compete. Building on insights from economic and political geography, it pays special attention to electoral and policy biases that can emerge when there is an asymmetric distribution of preferences across districts.},

We argue that the revolving-door incentivizes congressional staffers to showcase their legislative skills to the lobbying market in ways that affect policymaking in Congress. Using comprehensive data on congressional staffers, we find that employing staffers who later become lobbyists is associated with higher legislative productivity for members of Congress, especially in staffers' final terms in Congress. It also is associated with increases in a member's bill sponsorship in the areas of health and commerce, the topics most frequently addressed by clients in the lobbying industry, as well as granting more access to lobbying firms. These results provide the systematic empirical evidence of pre-exit effects of the revolving-door among congressional staff.},

Based on an analysis of U.S. House elections extending back to the antebellum era, we find that the incumbency advantage fluctuates in predictable ways over time with changes in nationalization, which can be a product of both institutional and political conditions. We also demonstrate that the increased influence of local forces in congressional elections may not be strictly necessary nor sufficient for the existence of an incumbency advantage.},

We show that for any society, no matter how large, faithful representation is possible by a committee with no more than m(m − 1)/2 members, where m is the number of alternatives. We also show that for any society, no matter how nonideological the bulk of its electorate, social preferences can be faithfully represented by a committee whose members all have singlepeaked or single-troughed preferences. Thus, all societies can be faithfully represented by a committee whose members see the world in unidimensional terms—that is, representatives can share a coherent ideological perspective even though the electorates they represent lack such a perspective. We further show that the usual mechanisms of proportional representation and the modified form of proportional representation recently proposed by Chamberlin and Courant (1983) do not guarantee faithful representation, and we discuss mechanisms that may provide faithful representation, even in a context in which new alternatives can arise.},

This rule, used also by other electoral authoritarian regimes, facilitates the manipulation of district magnitude and gerrymandering, especially the ‘stacking' form, to produce a large disproportionality which distorts the seats–votes linkage. It operates in an undemocratic fashion by precluding the opposition from gaining anything but token seats as long as the PAP remains the plurality-winning party.

@article{Hasen2019,
abstract = {The increased polarization in the United States among the political branches and citizenry affects the selection, work, perception, and relative power of state and federal judges, including justices of the US Supreme Court. Polarization in the United States over the last few decades matters to the American judicial system in at least four ways. First, polarization affects judicial selection , whether the selection method is (sometimes partisan-based) elections or appointment by political actors. In times of greater polarization, governors and presidents who nominate judges, legislators who confirm judges, and voters who vote on judicial candidates are more apt to support or oppose judges on the basis of partisan affiliation or cues. Second, driven in part by selection mechanisms, polarization may be reflected in the decisions that judges make, especially on issues that divide people politically, such as abortion , guns, or affirmative action. The Supreme Court, for example, often divides along party and ideological lines in the most prominent and highly contested cases. Those ideological lines now overlap with party as we enter a period in which all the Court liberals have been appointed by Democratic presidents and all the Court conservatives have been appointed by Republican presidents. Third, increasingly polarized judicial decisions appear to be causing the public to view judges and judicial decision making (at least on the US Supreme Court) through a more partisan lens. Fourth, polarization may affect the separation of powers, by empowering courts against polarized legislative bodies sometimes paralyzed by gridlock. The review concludes by considering how increased polarization may interact with the judiciary and judicial branch going forward and by suggesting areas for future research.},

I test this model on data for all California Assembly and congressional elections from 1970 through 1994, and compare it to more complicated equations that contain incumbency and socioeconomic variables. The simplest equations correctly predict nearly 90{\%} of the results. I show that analogous equations using registration or votes for minor or even major offices in California, North Carolina, and Texas can also predict outcomes with considerable accuracy. Using these equations, I show that the so-called ''Burton Gerrymander'' of 1980 had minimal partisan consequences, while the nonpartisan plan instituted by the California Supreme Court's Special Masters in 1992 was nearly as biased in favor of the Republicans as the proposal of the Republican party. I also introduce a new graphic representation of redistricting plans and conclude with a discussion of some seemingly methodological choices that have important substantive implications for assessing the fairness of redistricting plans.},

Political decision making is discussed at the levels of the group, organization, society, and supranational system. Unlike most other models in the coalition literature, the model presented: (a) is based on notions of ideological policy proximity rather than on notions such as least resources or zero-sum conflict; (b) posits a dynamic process of protocoalition formation which permits two actors to join in a (proto)coalition only when each is the other's most preferred partner; and (c) for sufficient information about the policy preferences/ideological views of the political actors, yields unique predictions as to which coalition can be expected to form.},

In the U.S., legislative elections in particular ought to provide opportunities for voters to replace incumbents with challengers. Yet the degree to which elections are contested varies to a surprising degree across time and between different legislatures. Our study documents and explains trends in uncontested seats in the U.S. Congress and state legislatures over time. To do so, we assemble an original dataset tracking all of these legislatures back to 1968 (and a smaller set back to 1920). We uncover a striking inconsistency: the frequency of uncontested seats in Congress has declined, but the frequency of uncontested seats in state legislatures has actually increased. We develop theoretical expectations to explain these divergent trends. We focus on factors that are common to both Congress and state legislatures such as the redistricting cycle but also institutional variables that are unique to the state level such as term limits, multi-member districts, and low levels of legislative professionalization. Our analysis points to the relative "flippability" of Congress compared to many state legislatures as a key factor behind diverging levels of contestation.},

Moreover, if there are regular cycles, can we construct an integrated model-such as a negative feedback loop-that identifies political forces that could generate the observed patterns? First, we use spectral analysis to test for the presence and length of cycles, and show that regular cycles do, in fact, exist-with periods that conform to those predicted by the Schlesingers-for swings between liberalism and conservatism-but with durations much shorter than those most commonly claimed by Burnham and others in characterizing American political realignments. Second, we offer a voter-party interaction model that depends on the tensions between parties' policy and office motivations and between voters' tendency to sustain incumbents while reacting against extreme policies. We find a plausible fit between the regular cycling that this model projects and the time series of two-party politics in America over the past century and a half.},

We present a new measure of partisan asymmetry that does not rely on the shapes of districts, is simple to compute, is provably related to the "packing and cracking" integral to gerrymandering, and that avoids the constitutionality issue presented by the efficiency gap. In addition, we introduce a generalization of the efficiency gap that also avoids the equivalency to proportional representation. We apply the first function to U.S. congressional and state legislative plans from recent decades to identify candidate gerrymanders.},

abstract = {High quality election districting plans provide representation to the broadest array of demographic groups possible. In rapidly diversifying countries such as the United States this goal will become of ever greater importance in the future. The quality and legality of districting plans are typically evaluated on the basis of a long list of criteria including contiguity, compactness, population equality, racial equity, the avoidance of splitting local government subdivisions, and the maintenance of communities of interest, among others. Do these criteria facilitate or inhibit the creation of districting plans facilitating high quality representation? Using the perspective of social justice, this paper evaluates current traditional redistricting evaluative criteria based upon the clarity of their goals and whether there are generally accepted methods for judging a plan's quality. It finds that the goals of some criteria are ill-defined with others having no accepted protocols to judge a plan's fidelity to these goals. It also argues that political geographers can have an important role in further refining the purpose and measurement of the current evaluative criteria used in the redistricting process.},

Here, we assess rules that are under consideration to be implemented by statute, particularly those specifying constraints and priorities for the districts themselves. We focus on potential rules to limit geographic splitting and to mandate population balance between districts. To address the impacts of these kinds of criteria, we generate large ensembles of valid districting plans while varying constraints and priorities, using Markov chain methods. We show in particular that tighter splitting rules chiefly "cut o↵ the tails" of the distribution of partisan outcomes, making the most skewed partisan maps into more extreme outliers. On the other hand, tightening or loosening population deviation has no e↵ect at all on the normal range of measurable outcomes. The lessons drawn here extend to dozens of other states that seek redistricting reform through amendment , statute, or citizen initiative: new rules have complicated e↵ects that can nonetheless be e↵ectively modeled on a state-by-state basis.},

Nor was this a chimera: the success of the Republican revolution in national policy-making had been predicated upon enormous artificial majorities that were produced in a Congress in which the Southern states were not represented. Indeed, the Republican fears were partially realized after 1872. Southern “Redemption” and the persistence of traditional Northern support for the Democrats resulted in a unique period of partisan deadlock which lasted from 1874 until Republican capture of all branches of the federal government in 1896.},

What is to be done? An extended history of successful congressional action suggests that the legislative pathway is more practical than often believed. Statutory requirements also make it possible to consider a broader suite of districting objectives. This paper presents a flexible new software and a framework for evaluating the practical implications of explicit objectives. I apply this approach to the conditions last required by Congress, generating equipopulous, contiguous, and compact districts. Among these conditions, the formal definition of compactness has proven contentious. Does it matter? I contrast the representation of the political parties and of racial and ethnic minorities under plans optimized according to 18 different definitions of compactness. On these grounds, the definitions are markedly consistent. These methods may be extended to alternative districting objectives and criteria.},

This framework helps us to explain the participation and preferences of groups regarding an issue; the perceived ideological fitand strategicbenefits of issue positions for parties; and how parties negotiate and manage issue conflict within their coalition. We apply that framework to the case of education policy, showing how education issue definition has changed over time—from a focus on resources and equality to an emphasis on values and excellence—and how those changes have been consequential for each party's changing, and converging, positions on education policy. We conclude by discussing the potential application of our model of party issue positioning to other issues in American politics.},

As a result of this method, researchers are able to distinguish between the intentional partisan bias caused by gerrymandering and the natural partisan bias that stems from the geographic sorting of partisan voters. However, this research has yet to explore the effect of gerrymandering on other biases like reduced electoral competition and incumbency protection. Using a computer algorithm to design a set of districts without political intent, I measure the extent to which the current districts have been gerrymandered to produce safer seats in Congress. I find that gerrymandering only has a minor effect on the average district, but does produce a number of safe seats for both Democrats and Republicans. Moreover, these safe seats tend to be located in states where a single party controls the districting process.},

Cross-sectional models for the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 1990s are tested with ordinary least squares regression techniques, using states as the unit of analysis. We find that racial diversity is a potent negative predictor of turnout levels, in each time period and in non-Southern, as well as Southern, states and that it has an especially strong relationship in presidential elections. Racial diversity is also associated nationwide with weak state and national mobilizing forces, and more difficult voter registration requirements.},

New organizational forms – including informal institutions, transgovernmental networks and private transnational regulatory organizations – have expanded rapidly, while the growth of formal intergovernmental organizations has slowed.  Organizational ecology provides an insightful framework for understanding these changing patterns of growth.  Organizational ecology is primarily a structural theory, emphasizing the influence of institutional environments, especially their organizational density and resource availability, on organizational behavior and viability. To demonstrate the explanatory value of organizational ecology, we analyze the proliferation of private transnational regulatory organizations (PTROs), compared to the relative stasis of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).  Continued growth of IGOs is constrained by crowding in their dense institutional environment, but PTROs benefit from organizational flexibility and low entry costs, which allow them to enter “niches” with limited resource competition.  We probe the plausibility of our analysis by examining contemporary climate governance.},

We provide evidence that the de facto effects of President Trump's campaign rhetoric and vague policy positions extended beyond the direct effects of his executive orders.

Our results provide evidence that they withdrew from public view: (1) Shared locations on Twitter dropped approximately 10 to 20{\%} among users with Arabic-sounding names after major campaign and election events and (2) Muslim survey respondents reported increased public space avoidance.},

The public drew many plans submitted for judging in a competition hosted by reform advocates, who awarded a prize to the plan that scored best on a formula composed of four permissive components: compactness, respect for local political boundaries, partisan fairness, and competition. We evaluate how the legislature's adopted plan compares to these plans on the advocates' criteria and our alternative set of criteria, which reveals the degree by which the legislature placed partisanship over these other criteria. Our evaluation reveals minimal trade-offs among the components of the overall competition's scoring criteria, but we caution that the scoring formula may be sensitive to implementation choices among its components. Compared to the legislature's plan, the reform community can get more of the four criteria they value; importantly, without sacrificing the state's only African-American opportunity congressional district.},

However, a changed partisan environment along with new empirical evidence raises unanswered questions about the effect of congressional performance on incumbents' electoral outcomes over time. Analysis ofHouse reelection races across the last several decades produces important findings: (1) low congressional approval ratings generally reduce the electoral margins of majority party incumbents and increase margins for minority party incumbents; (2) partisan polarization in the House increases the magnitude of this partisan differential, mainly through increased electoral accountability among majority party incumbents; (3) these electoral effects of congressional performance ratings hold largely irrespective of a member's individual party loyalty or seat safety. These findings carry significant implications for partisan theories of legislative organization and help explain salient features of recent Congresses.},

We expand this list of potential shortcomings by arguing that ideological congruence with a constituency may be another factor in explaining challenger defeat. Using ideology measures derived from campaign contributions, we find that unsuccessful challengers in the U.S. House are generally more extreme than those who win, but ideological extremity is not a disadvantage to those seeking to represent an extreme constituency. More importantly, our existing political institutions may actually serve to mitigate the already high levels of partisan polarization in Congress.},

@article{Huber2008,
abstract = {W e examine the stability of individual ministers across parliamentary democracies. Our data show that this stability is only loosely related to the stability of cabinets, making it impossible to rely primarily on arguments about cabinet duration to explain patterns of individual stability. We argue that to explain patterns of individual stability, it is useful to focus on the problems that party leaders have in identifying which individuals have the qualities necessary to do their jobs well. The institutional powers of ministers, coalition attributes, and party-specific variables should affect the uncertainty that party leaders have about which individuals will be successful ministers, on one hand, and the ability of party leaders to replace unsuccessful ministers, on the other. Our empirical tests support these arguments. The analysis therefore has implications for expectations regarding the circumstances under which minister stability should positively or negatively influence the policymaking performance of government. I n parliamentary democracies, individual ministers play the central role in policy formulation and implementation. Policymaking success therefore requires that governing parties assign well-qualified individuals to key cabinet posts, and that these ministers remain in office long enough to do their jobs effectively. If ministers are incompetent, or if competent ministers are removed from office before they have an opportunity to make an impact on their departments, it will be difficult for governing majorities to develop and implement their preferred policy programs. The quality of policymaking processes should therefore be influenced by turnover among ministers, which can impede the accumulation of experience necessary for effective governance. At one extreme, if ministers in key portfolios were replaced daily, it would be impossible for parties to achieve their policy objectives. But changes in ministers are not always a bad thing. At the other extreme, if ministers were never replaced, regardless of their performance, this should hardly be viewed as good for democracy. In fact, turnover can help governments improve the public's confidence in their performance (Dewan and Dowding 2005) and can serve as a tool to control the ministers responsible for the most powerful and organizationally complex departments (Indridason and Kam 2005, Forthcoming). Turnover can reflect the need for innovation and renewal in policymaking or it can reflect underlying conflict and instability. Hence, the relationship between turnover and political performance should depend crucially on the underlying causes of turnover. This paper examines the stability of individual ministers in parliamentary systems. One source of instability is government failure, and our study is therefore related},

abstract = {Intro: Belief systems have never surrendered easily to empirical study or quantification. Indeed, they have often served as primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study. In an earlier period, the behaviorist decree that subjective states lie beyond the realm of proper measurement gave Mannheim a justification for turning his back on measurement, for he had an unqualified interest in discussing belief systems.1 Even as Mannheim was writing, however, behaviorism was undergoing stiff challenges, and early studies of attitudes were attaining a degree of measurement reliability that had been deemed impossible. This fragment of history, along with many others, serves to remind us that no intellectual position is likely to become obsolete quite so rapidly as one that takes current empirical capability as the limit of the possible in a more absolute sense. Nevertheless, while rapid strides in the measurement of "subjective states" have been achieved in recent decades, few would claim that the millennium has arrived or that Mannheim could now find all of the tools that were lacking to him forty years ago.},

Moreover, we use news articles about tax avoidance to provide a salient proxy to employees about tax avoidance that is plausibly exogenous to our models. Using S{\&}P 500 firms and staggered difference-indifferences specifications, we find that tax avoidance news negatively affects employee perceptions of managers and firms. In cross-sectional tests, we find that (1) firms and managers in consumer-facing industries suffer higher employee-related reputation costs from tax avoidance compared to other firms, and (2) well-performing firms and their managers face lower reputation costs than other firms and managers. Further, we find that employee compensation increases in response to tax media coverage. Overall, our results are consistent with tax avoidance imposing reputation costs on managers and firms.},

abstract = {To prevent gerrymandering, and to impose a specific form of democratic representation , many state constitutions and judicial opinions require US legislative districts to be "compact." Yet, the law offers few precise definitions other than "you know it when you see it," which effectively implies a common understanding of the concept. In contrast, academics have shown that the concept has multiple theoretical dimensions and have generated large numbers of conflicting empirical measures. This has proved extremely challenging for courts tasked with adjudicating compactness. We hypothesize that both are correct-that compactness is complex and multidimen-sional, but a common understanding exists across people. We develop a survey design to elicit this understanding, without bias in favor of one's own political views, and with high levels of reliability (in data where the standard paired comparisons approach fails). We then create a statistical model that predicts, with high accuracy and solely from the geometric features of the district, compactness evaluations by 96 judges, justices, and public officials responsible for redistricting (and 102 redistrict-ing consultants, expert witnesses, law professors, law students, graduate students, undergraduates, and Mechanical Turk workers). We also offer data on compactness from our validated measure for 18,215 state legislative and congressional districts, as well as software to compute this measure from any district. We then discuss what may be the wider applicability of our general methodological approach to measuring important concepts that you only know when you see.

A second distortion—partisan biases in responsiveness—has been less well studied and is often ignored or downplayed in the literature on affluent influence. We are the first to evaluate, in tandem, these two potential distortions in representation. We do so using 49 Senate roll-call votes from 2001 to 2015. We find that affluent influence is overstated and itself contingent on partisanship—party trumps the purse when senators have to take sides. The poor get what they want more often from Democrats. The rich get what they want more often from Republicans, but only if Republican constituents side with the rich. Thus, partisanship induces, shapes, and constrains affluent influence.},

@article{Aldrich1993,
abstract = {Turning out to vote is the most common and important act of political participation in any democracy. Voting is also less well understood and explained empirically than other political acts engaged in regularly by citizens. Turnout, however, presents a special problem for rational choice theories of politics, for it is taken to be the paradigmatic example of the problem of collective action, in which, although all may benefit from voting, it is rarely in the individual's self-interest to vote. This paper begins by examining the problem of explaining turnout. A basic form of rational choice models of turnout is developed-basic in the sense that it is common to all such models. This basic model is shown to be incomplete, and the two most important models, the calculus of voting and the minimax regret model, are illustrated as alternative ways to complete this basic model, along with mention of game-theoretic models. Their strengths and weaknesses are then assessed. The remainder of the paper argues that rational choice accounts of turnout are possible. The first step is to argue that turnout is not an especially problematic version of the collec- tive action problem because it is, for many, a low cost, low (expected) benefit decision. A "strategic politicians" account of turnout and campaigns is examined next. A reinterpre- tation of the intrinsic benefits of voting is then considered and is used to examine the most important substantive problem in the turnout literature, its decline. These steps, I argue, make theories of ordinary political decisions at once both more political and more integrated into the politics of the larger system.},

To assess the veracity of those alternative views, a bespoke data set showing percentage support for the Democratic Party's presidential candidates at the county, state, and divisional scales has been analyzed using a robust, statistically based measure of polarization and segregation. The ecological results provide clear and compelling evidence of a trend toward greater polarization across the nine census divisions, across the forty-nine states within those divisions, and across the 3,077 counties within the states—with strong evidence that the differences over time at the last of those scales are highly statistically significant. Within those general trends, polarization has been greater in some states than others and also within some states more than others— identifying additional geographies calling for further research.},

A key concern with such aggregation, however, is that changes in the units of aggregation themselves cause difficulty in comparing data gathered on the old boundaries and the new boundaries. Such changes present serious concerns to researchers who may exclude observations or cases due to a lack of comparable units or omit certain key variables. While geographers have long examined this problem and created methods of projecting data from one spatial unit into another, known as areal interpolation, it is telling that a recent article notes the difficulty for researchers in implementing even the most basic solutions without relying heavily on programming skills or proprietary software.},

@article{Stephanopoulos2015,
abstract = {The usual legal story about partisan gerrymandering is relentlessly pessimistic. The courts did not even recognize the cause of action until the 1980s; they have never struck down a district plan on this basis; and four sitting justices want to vacate the field altogether. The Supreme Court's most recent gerrymandering decision, however, is the most encouraging development in this area in a generation. Several justices expressed interest in the concept of partisan symmetry-the idea that a plan should treat the major parties symmetrically in terms of the conversion of votes to seats- and suggested that it could be shaped into a legal test. In this Article, we take the justices at their word. First, we introduce a new measure of partisan symmetry: the efficiency gap. It represents the difference between the parties' respective wasted votes in an election, divided by the total number of votes cast. It captures, in a single tidy number, all of the packing and cracking decisions that go into a district plan. It also is superior to the metric of gerrymandering, partisan bias, that litigants and scholars have used until now. Partisan bias can be calculated only by shifting votes to simulate a hypothetical tied election. The efficiency gap eliminates the need for such counterfactual analysis. Second, we compute the efficiency gap for congressional and state house plans between 1972 and 2012. Over this period as a whole, the typical plan was fairly balanced and neither party enjoyed a systematic advantage. But in recent years- and peaking in the 2012 election-plans have exhibited steadily larger and more pro-Republican gaps. In fact, the plans in effect today are the most extreme gerrymanders in modern history. And what is more, several are likely to remain extreme for the remainder of the decade, as indicated by our sensitivity testing. Finally, we explain how the efficiency gap could be converted into doctrine. We propose setting thresholds above which plans would be presumptively unconstitutional: two seats for congressional plans and 8 percent for state house plans, but only if the plans probably will stay unbalanced for the remainder of the cycle. Plans with gaps above these thresholds would be unlawful unless states could show that the gaps either resulted from the consistent application of legitimate policies or were inevitable due to the states' political geography. This approach would neatly slice the Gordian knot the Court has tied for itself, explicitly replying to the Court's "unanswerable questions" of "[h]ow much political... effect is too much.".},

abstract = {Several commentators before and after the 2016 US presidential election claimed that it involved a “redrawing of the country's electoral map”, which in the context of the Key/Pomper classification of elections suggested that it was a deviating election, and potentially a critical election heralding a realignment. Analysis of the geography of the result of the 2016 contest, however, indicates considerable continuity at the county scale: the main trend was an increase in the spatial polarization of the US electorate. Trump not only performed best in 2016 in those counties where Republican party candidates had done well at the previous nine elections, he also increased the Republican share of the votes cast in many of them relative to his performance in counties where the Democratic party candidates were strong then. The main deviations from this trend were in counties with large Black and/or Hispanic populations and those with relatively large numbers of well-qualified, well-paid adults. It was not a potential critical election, therefore, but a continuation of a sequence now nearly four decades old.},

First to put in one place for the convenience of both scholars and practitioners the basic data on redistricting practices in democracies around the world. Remarkably, this data has never before been collected. Second, to provide a series of short case studies that look in more detail at particular countries with regard to the institutions and practices that have evolved for redistricting and the nature of the debates that have arisen. Third, to begin to look in comparative perspective at the consequences of alternative redistricting mechanisms and at the tradeoffs among competing redistricting criteria. This volume has contributions from some of the leading specialists on redistricting in the world. The chapters reflect a mix of country-specific material, chapters that are broadly comparative, and chapters whose contributions are more methodological in nature. The chapters in this volume provide an indispensable introduction to the institutions, practices, and consequences of boundary delimitation around the world.

This article presents two experiments that undermine this concern, at least under one important condition. People rarely possess even a modicum of information about policies; but when they do, their attitudes seem to be affected at least as much by that information as by cues from party elites. The experiments also measure the extent to which people think about policy. Contrary to many accounts, they suggest that party cues do not inhibit such thinking. This is not cause for unbridled optimism about citizens' ability to make good decisions, but it is reason to be more sanguine about their ability to use information about policy when they have it.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Professor Manin challenges the conventional view that representative democracy is no more than an indirect form of government by the people, in which citizens elect representatives only because they cannot assemble and govern in person. The argument is developed by examining the historical moments when the present institutional arrangements were chosen from among the then available alternatives. Professor Manin reminds us that while today representative institutions and democracy appear as virtually indistinguishable, when representative government was first established in Europe and America, it was designed in opposition to democracy proper. Drawing on the procedures used in earlier republican systems, from classical Athens to Renaissance Florence, in order to highlight the alternatives that were forsaken, Manin brings to the fore the generally overlooked results of representative mechanisms. These include the elitist aspect of elections and the non-binding character of campaign promises.},

We develop a general statistical model of the relationship between votes and seats and separate these two important concepts theoretically and empirically. In so doing, we also solve several methodological problems with the study of seats, votes, and the cube law. An application to U.S. congressional districts provides estimates of bias and representation for each state and demonstrates the model's utility. Results of this application show distinct types of representation coexisting in U.S. states. Although most states have small partisan biases, there are some with a substantial degree of bias.},

We also test the construct validity of the COVI using both state-level and individual-level voter turnout. After controlling for other considerations, we find aggregate voter turnout is lower in states with higher index values and self-reported turnout also drops in states with larger index values.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between corruption and political stability, from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. We propose a model of incumbent behavior that features the interplay of two effects: a horizon effect , whereby greater instability leads the incumbent to embezzle more during his short window of opportunity, and a demand effect , by which the private sector is more willing to bribe stable incumbents. The horizon effect dominates at low levels of stability, because firms are unwilling to pay high bribes and unstable incumbents have strong incentives to embezzle, whereas the demand effect gains salience in more stable regimes. Together, these two effects generate a non-monotonic, U-shaped relationship between total corruption and stability. On the empirical side, we find a robust U-shaped pattern between country indices of corruption perception and various measures of incumbent stability, including historically observed average tenures of chief executives and governing parties: regimes that are very stable or very unstable display higher levels of corruption when compared with those in an intermediate range of stability. These results suggest that minimizing corruption may require an electoral system that features some re-election incentives, but with an eventual term limit. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In contemporary campaigns, this results in a situation in which many voters are entirely unexposed to campaign activities over the duration of the campaign. The implications of lopsided communications that relegate voters in uncompetitive states to bystander status in presidential campaigns are potentially significant and merit greater scrutiny. In this study, I analyze how the dynamics of voter preferences in uncompetitive states compare to those in battleground states. Using data from the 2000 National Annenberg Election Survey, I find that the preferences of voters in battleground states are more variable but more stable than their counterparts in nonbattleground states.

For instance, inexperience and poor funding can significantly inhibit challenger success. We expand this list of potential shortcomings by arguing that ideological congruence with a constituency may be another factor in explaining challenger defeat. Using ideology measures derived from campaign contributions, we find that unsuccessful challengers in the U.S. House are generally more extreme than those who win, but ideological extremity is not a disadvantage to those seeking to represent an extreme constituency. More importantly, our existing political institutions may actually serve to mitigate the already high levels of partisan polarization in Congress.},

The incumbency advantage has diminished in conjunction with an increase in party loyalty, straight-ticket voting, and president-centered electoral nationalization, products of the widening and increasingly coherent partisan divisions in the American electorate. Consequently, House incumbents now have a much harder time retaining districts that lean toward the rival party. Democrats had been the main beneficiaries of the denationalization of electoral politics that had enabled the incumbency advantage to grow, and they have thus been the main victims of the reemergence of a more party-centered electoral process. Republicans enjoy a long-standing structural advantage in the distribution of partisans across districts, so this trend has strengthened their grip on the House even as they have become less competitive in contests for the presidency.},

I draw upon survey evidence from World War II and the current war in Iraq to come to a common conclusion regarding public support for international interventions. I find little evidence that citizens make complex cost/benefit calculations when evaluating military action. Instead, I find that patterns of elite conflict shape opinion concerning war. When political elites disagree as to the wisdom of intervention, the public divides as well. But when elites come to a common interpretation of a political reality, the public gives them great latitude to wage war.},

A major challenge to answering this question is in determining the outcomes that would have resulted in the absence of gerrymandering. Since we only observe Congressional elections where the districts have potentially been gerrymandered, we lack a non-gerrymandered counterfactual that would allow us to isolate its true effect. To overcome this challenge, we conduct computer simulations of the districting process to redraw the boundaries of Congressional districts without partisan intent. By estimating the outcomes of these non-gerrymandered districts, we are able to establish the non-gerrymandered counterfactual against which the actual outcomes can be compared. The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in Congress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan districting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors other than partisan intent in the districting process.},

Yet prior tests have considered only a few immigrant attributes at a time, limiting their capacity to test several hypotheses simultaneously. This paper uses conjoint analysis to test the influence of nine randomized immigrant attributes in generating support for admission. Drawing on a two-wave, population-based panel survey, it demonstrates that Americans view educated immigrants in high-status jobs favorably, while they view those who lack plans to work, entered without authorization, come from Iraq, or do not speak English unfavorably. The results are consistent with norms-based and sociotropic explanations of immigration attitudes. Remarkably, Americans' preferences vary little with their education, partisanship, labor market position, ethnocentrism, or other attributes. Beneath partisan divisions over immigration lies a consensus about which immigrants to admit, a fact which points to limits in both theories emphasizing economic threats and those emphasizing cultural threats.},

abstract = {We consider whether a career-minded expert would make better decisions if the principal could observe the consequences of the expert's action. The previous literature has found that this "transparency of consequence" can only improve the efficacy of the expert's decision making. We show, however, that this conclusion is very sensitive to the specified cost structure: if learning the consequences of the expert's action makes the expert more likely to choose the action most likely to correspond to the true state of the world, when costs are asymmetric, this can be associated with a decrease in the principal's expected welfare. In addition, we show that, when the prior on the state of the world is sufficiently strong, if the principal benefits from learning the consequences of the expert's action, her utility is higher if she observes only the consequences and not the action taken. For such priors, the optimal transparency regime will involve either the principal observing only the expert's action or only the consequences of the expert's action: it will never be optimal to observe both. We illustrate these results with examples from finance and public policymaking. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {According to numerous studies, campaign and news media messages can alter the importance individuals place on an issue when evaluating politicians, an effect called priming. Research on priming revived scholarly interest in campaign and media effects and implied, according to some, that campaigns and the media can manipulate voters. There are, however, alternative explanations for these priming findings, alternatives that previous studies have not fully considered. In this article, I reanalyze four cases of alleged priming, using panel data to test priming effects against these alternatives. Across these four cases, I find little evidence of priming effects. Instead, campaign and media attention to an issue creates the appearance of priming through a two-part process: Exposing individuals to campaign and media messages on an issue (1) informs some of them about the parties' or candidates' positions on that issue. Once informed, (2) these individuals often adopt their preferred party's or candidate's position as their own. {\textcopyright} 2009, Midwest Political Science Association.},

Competitive campaigns have been found to increase citizens' participation, engagement and learning. However, little is known about whether the effects of competitive campaigns have enduring consequences for citizens' attitudes and behavior. Analyzing a survey of citizens conducted one year after the 2006 congressional elections that includes an oversample of respondents from competitive House races, we examine whether exposure to a competitive House campaign affects voters' political knowledge and political interest as well as their consumption of political news. We find that competitive elections have positive effects that endure for at least a year beyond the campaign season, reinforcing the idea that political competition plays a robust role in American representative democracy.},

In this paper, we examine two commonly used majoritarian electoral systems-the multiple nontransferable votes (MNTV) and single-member districts decided by plurality (SMDP). We look at strategic entry by elites and strategic voting by citizens. Coordination failures at either stage could keep teams of candidates out of office who might have otherwise been chosen to govern and could prevent voters from putting in office the candidates who would best represent them. For causal identification , we leverage the design of Brazil's senate, where both systems are alternately used. Using a difference-indifferences approach, we find that elites do not coordinate well under SMDP but do relatively better under MNTV while voters coordinate equally (well) across both systems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTThe 2016 election highlights two major—and closely related—gaps in the American politics subfield. First, Americanists who study contemporary politics have avoided questions about whether institutions are durable, in effect treating state legitimacy as a solved problem. In fact, as this election shows, institutions are more fragile, and questions about durability more important, than Americanists tend to assume. A focus on the institutional treatment of ethnoracial minorities reveals ongoing issues of incomplete democratization and troubling legitimacy in American politics. Second, the 2016 election shows that ethnic and racial politics are central, not peripheral, to American politics—and should be central to Americanist political science as well. Trump's success in appealing to rural white voters with an explicitly ethnonationalist stance makes clear that ethnic politics are not solely or even primarily the property of ethnoracial minorities. Rather, they play a central role in most important de...},

Drawing on a database of US highway construction since the passage of 1956 highway legislation, it shows that suburban Interstate highways made suburban counties less Democratic, especially in the South and where highways were built earlier. Metropolitan areas with denser Interstate networks also became more polarized. Analysis of the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study (1965-97) reveals individual-level mechanisms underlying these changes: Interstates drew more white and affluent residents, who tended to be Republican, to the suburbs.},

In 1997, the OMB issued a revised version of this classification in which small changes may profoundly affect the way policymakers and the American public think about race. At the very least, these revisions present significant challenges to social scientists who study race and ethnicity.

This descriptive assessment is undertaken according to important regional (Non-South and South) and subregional (Rim South and Deep South) contexts in American politics. We then perform multivariate analyses of the likelihood of electing black legislators across three periods following the marked increase in the creation of majority-minority districts (1993?1995, 2003?2005, 2013?2015). Because of sectional variation in the partisan strength of the major parties, the probability of achieving black representation is significantly different depending upon whether a contest occurs in the Non-South, Rim South, or Deep South, with the latter constituting of the highest threshold of black population necessary to elect an African-American. By merging an original dataset on state legislative elections with the most complete evaluation of the factors shaping the election of black lawmakers, our findings shed new light on minority representation and how sectional differences greatly affect the electoral success of African-Americans.},

We test the argument with survey evidence from 34 African countries. To provide causal evidence, we conduct difference-in-differences analyses leveraging Ghana's three presidential transitions since 2000. Across Africa, support for judicial power is high, while trust in courts is lower. However, presidential co-partisans are less supportive of horizontal judicial power over the president and more supportive of vertical power over the people.

A formal model demonstrates that this institutional design produces more moderate legislative outcomes despite the preferences of the majority coalition. The model's predictions are tested using coalition sizes on conference report votes in the states. Controlling for other factors, chambers which allow the minority to propose a competing conference report have larger coalitions, on average, though this effect is mitigated by interchamber distance. Further, rejection of the conference bill is also much less likely because the majority cannot propose extreme bills.

abstract = {[Several aggregate-level studies have found a relationship between macroeconomic conditions and election outcomes, operating in intuitively plausible directions. More recent survey-based studies, however, have been unable to detect any comparable relationship operating at the individual-voter level. This persistent discrepancy is puzzling. One recently proposed explanation for it is that voters actually behave in an altruistic or @'sociotropic@' fashion, responding to economic events only as they affect the general welfare, rather than in terms of self-interested @'pocketbook@' considerations. It is argued here that the discrepancies between the macro- and microlevel studies are a statistical artifact, arising from the fact that observable changes in individual welfare actually consist of two unobservable components, a government-induced (and politically relevant) component, and an exogenous component caused by life-cycle and other politically irrelevant factors. Because of this, individual level cross-sectional estimates of the effects of welfare changes on voting are badly biased and are essentially unrelated to the true values of the behavioral parameters of interest: they will generally be considerable underestimates and may even be of the wrong sign. An aggregate-level time-series analysis, on the other hand, will often yield reasonably good (if somewhat attenuated) estimates of the underlying individual-level effects of interest. Therefore, in this case, individual behavior is best investigated with aggregate- rather than individual-level data. It is also shown that the evidence for sociotropic voting is artifactual, in the sense that the various findings and evidence which ostensibly show sociotropic behavior are all perfectly compatible with the null hypothesis of self-interested, pocketbook voting.]},

abstract = {Objectives: We offer a typology of possible reforms to the Electoral College (EC) in terms of changes to its two most important structural features: seat allocations that are not directly proportional to population and winner-take-all outcomes at the state level. This typology allows us to classify four major variants of “reform” to the present EC in a parsimonious fashion. Many of the proposals we consider have been suggested by well-known figures, some debated in Congress, and they include what we view as most likely to be taken seriously. We evaluate these proposals solely in terms of one simple criterion: “Would they be expected to reduce the likelihood of inversions between EC and popular vote outcomes?”. Methods: We answer this question by looking at the data on actual presidential election outcomes at the state level over the entire period 1868–2016, and at the congressional-district level over the period 1956–2016. We consider the implications for presidential outcomes of these different alternative mechanisms, in comparison to the actual electoral outcome and the popular vote outcome. In addition, we consider the implications of a proposal to increase the size of the U.S. House (Ladewig and Jasinski, 2008). Results: Our results show that inversions from the popular vote happen under all proposed alternatives at nearly the same rate as under the current EC rules, with some proposals actually making inversions more frequent. Conclusions: The major difference between the present EC rule and alternative rules is not in frequency of inversions, but is in which particular years the inversions occur. As for the proposal to increase the size of the House, we show that any realistic increase in House size would have made no difference for the 2016 outcome.},

abstract = {A continuing tradition in contextual analysis locates individual citizens within spatially defined, aggregate settings in an effort to provide a more complete account of individual behavior. Given the increasing individual mobility within society, it is less than clear that geography continues to define the boundaries on meaningful aggregate contexts—people have become less tied to their geographic contexts, and technology makes it possible for citizens to maintain relationships independently of space, distance, and location. In this paper we pursue an analysis and set of analytic techniques that are designed to connect individual voters, their communication networks, and the geography that surrounds them. The analytic techniques utilize a unique data set that captures spatial dispersion in an individual's social and political network, and from these analyses we can draw two conclusions. First, spatial dispersion in a network does have an effect on interaction within the network; the world is not full of voters who operate independently of their geographic contexts. Second, spatial dispersion provides opportunities to connect citizens living in different geographic contexts, thereby creating bridges for communication across different contexts. These findings suggest that scholars might profitably incorporate geography as an important component of the complex relationships among and between individual citizens in explaining the role of the individual in modern democratic politics.},

According to this argument, primary electorates are dominated by strong partisans whose views are more extreme than those of rank-and-file party supporters. This article uses data from recent exit polls of primary and general election voters as well as the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study to test the primary election polarization theory. The evidence does not support the theory. In fact there appears to be very little difference between the ideologies of each party's primary voters and the ideologies of its general election voters. These findings suggest that the polarized state of American politics today reflects the polarized state of the overall American electorate rather than any peculiar characteristics of primary voters. The findings also suggest that even after they secure their party's nomination, it may be risky for candidates to adopt more moderate policy positions in order to appeal to swing voters, because any such move toward the center would risk alienating a large proportion of their party's electoral base.},

abstract = {The United States does not provide for direct election of its chief executive but utilizes the Electoral College to represent voter choices. Central to this institution is the "winner-take-all" model by which electoral votes in all states but two are awarded to the candidate who garners a plurality of that state's popular vote. As game theorists have long pointed out, this system introduces several biases in voter power that differentially reward or punish voters based on each state's population or electorate. This article offers a historical overview of the Electoral College and the geographic biases in voter power it introduces. It extends the influential binomial model of voter power proposed by Banzhaf in the 1960s to include a multinomial approach sensitive to the presence of more than two parties, the absolute and relative margins of victories, and the number of electoral votes in each state. It then applies this approach to U.S. presidential elections from 1960 to 2004 utilizing a series of cartograms. Next, the article examines voter power differentials between the two major political parties, five ethnic groups, rural and urban areas, and ten religious denominations in the 2000 and 2004 elections. Finally, it links contemporary discussions of voter power to theories of democracy, arguing that the electoral power can only be understood in contingent, temporally fluid, and geographically specific terms.},

Unfortunately, however, the efficiency gap reduces to proportional representation , an expectation that is not a constitutional right. We present a new measure of partisan asymmetry that does not rely on the shapes of districts, is simple to compute, is provably related to the ''packing and cracking'' integral to gerrymandering, and that avoids the constitutionality issue presented by the efficiency gap. In addition, we introduce a generalization of the efficiency gap that also avoids the equivalency to proportional representation.

abstract = {The electoral fortunes of state parties are partly shaped by the positions adopted by national parties. This creates the potential dilemma: The position that is best for the national party might be too extreme for the electorate in some states. Some state parties attempt to address this problem by adopting more moderate positions than their national-level counterparts. We argue that the efficacy of state party moderation hinges on the degree of polarization at the national level. We develop theory and examine empirical evidence that higher relative polarization at the national level exacerbates the degree to which national party positions and loyalties determine outcomes in U.S. state elections. When relative national polarization is high, we find evidence that state legislative election outcomes are determined by states' orientations toward the national parties rather than the positions taken by state legislative parties. 788050A PRXXX10.1177/1532673X18788050American Politics ResearchZingher and Richman research-article2018 2 American Politics Research 00(0) extremely difficult for any Kentucky Democrat to overcome the Trump tide " (Loftus, 2016). Although scholars have long noted the influence of national electoral conditions on state election outcomes (e.g., Chubb, 1988; Makse, 2014), this leaves some questions unanswered. For instance, Ronald Reagan's 1984 margin in the state of 60{\%} was only slightly smaller than Trump's 2016 margin, yet the Kentucky Democrats' majority in state legislature was not in doubt. Why did Kentucky Democrats overcome Reagan but not Trump? While regional realignment might be a proximate explanation, our study sug-gests that a complementary answer to puzzles of this sort lies in the interac-tion between state and national party polarization and party position taking. U.S. national party polarization has been increasing for decades (Hare {\&} Poole 2014; McCarty, Poole, {\&} Rosenthal, 2006). There has been a similar trend toward increased polarization in many—but not all—states (Shor {\&} McCarty, 2011). This article asks how increased national polarization has altered politics in the U.S. states and whether aspects of the politics of par-ticular states (e.g., party positioning) conditioned the impact of the national pattern. There is evidence that the national-and state-level parties have become increasingly ideologically homogeneous (Wright, 2016; Wright {\&} Birkhead, 2014) which suggests that one response to increased national polarization may be a washing-out of state-level differences in the party coalitions. There is also evidence that individuals have an easier time identi-fying which party best reflects their policy orientations when the choices they are presented with are distinct because of polarization (Levendusky, 2010; Smidt, 2017; Zingher {\&} Flynn, 2018). David R. Jones (2015) finds evidence that increasing partisan polarization in Congress has increased the impor-tance of evaluations of Congress for perceptions of the party's brand and has increased the influence of congressional performance evaluations on partisan seat change in state legislatures. Our analysis builds upon these insights with evidence for a dynamic inter-action—National (and state) polarization conditions national influence on state legislative elections. We argue that increased national polarization will increase the weight placed upon national party positions when voters make choices in state elections. We then present aggregate evidence from state election outcomes extending from 1994 to 2014 (and from 1941 to 2014 with less detailed measures) that shows strong evidence for the expected patterns. Theory and evidence indicate that increased national polarization (and the degree to which national parties are more polarized than state parties) increases the role of the national party alignment in voter choices and under-mines state party efforts to win on the basis of distinctive policy positions. Where national party polarization dominates, support for national party can-didates strongly predicts state legislative electoral choices.},

Through Walter Benjamin, I conceptualize the relationship between racial violence and law, and note that although violence can support the authority of law, excessive violence makes law vulnerable to decay. This tension between authority and excess is eased by humanitarianism. I find clues for disrupting this circulation in Benjamin's twin notions of the real state of exception and the general strike, introduced two decades apart and invested in theorizing how labor and other marginalized groups threaten the stability of law supported by violence. This reconstruction proceeds alongside an examination of the contemporary US regime of immigration enforcement, which combines the excessive violence of detention and deportation with marginal humanitarian adjustments, which ultimately legitimate violence. On the disruptive side, a Benjaminian reading of labor activism by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers offers three dimensions of emancipatory politics: (a) practices of refusal (to engage on the terms of the immigration debate), (b) the establishment of historical constellations (of racial regulation of labor constitutive of law), and (c) divine violence (through exposure of lawful violence in the food production chain).},

We are the first to evaluate, in tandem, these two potential distortions in representation. We do so using 49 Senate roll-call votes from 2001 to 2015. We find that affluent influence is overstated and itself contingent on partisanship - party trumps the purse when senators have to take sides. The poor get what they want more often from Democrats. The rich get what they want more often from Republicans, but only if Republican constituents side with the rich. Thus, partisanship induces, shapes, and constrains affluent influence.},

This troubling result suggests that incumbents are ‘‘underpenalized'' for bad economic performance. We challenge this conclusion theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we argue that a worsening economy has a disruptive effect that prods worried citizens to voice concern and seek remedies. Empirically, we analyze county-level data and find that, contrary to earlier studies, higher unemployment rates in fact stimulate more people to vote. We show that the effect is not the result of heightened electoral competition when unemployment is high. The relationship displays a partisan asymmetry in which Republican candidates are especially harmed by higher unemployment. The results also indicate that studies of economic voting need to consider the role of turnout in connecting economic performance to the incumbent's vote share.},

Winning control of the redistricting process offers the prospect of shaping elections for the next decade, making majority status significantly more valuable than it otherwise might be. Partisan tides, on the contrary, can dramatically alter perceptions of which seats are safe or vulnerable and of whether majority status is obtainable or not. In this article, I examine how the proximity of redistricting and the presence of partisan tides are reflected in the strategies of the party organizations that contest state legislative elections. Using party finance data from 29 states during the period from 1996 to 2010, I find that parties' majority-seeking behavior is more intense in states with legislative redistricting, when redistricting is imminent, and when partisan tides favor the minority party.]},

We find that the effect of professionalization on incumbent electoral success is far more pervasive. As the level of professionalism of a legislature increases, the effects of external political and economic forces (such as coattails from higher level elections and national economic conditions) on a legislator's chances for reelection diminish in strength. This implies that legislative professionalization promotes institutionalization by establishing boundaries that insulate members from external shocks. We reach these conclusions by specifying and testing a district-level model of state legislative election outcomes, using as dependent variable the probability that an incumbent will win reelection. The model is estimated with probit using data for more than 42,000 state legislators from 1970 to 1989.},

For fairer maps, it appears to be necessary to "anti-gerrymander" by relaxing the traditional criteria in order to overcome the political geography in Pennsylvania which apparently makes a Democratic gerrymander practically impossible. The methodology uses five statewide data bases at the precinct level and suitably constructed seats/votes curves. If fairness and responsiveness are valued more than political geography, then they should be made explicit criteria in congressional districting, at least in Pennsylvania.},

abstract = {Objective: Record numbers of first- and second-generation immigrants have won elected office over the last few electoral cycles, yet we find immigrants are still underrepresented at all levels of government. What are the perceived barriers to entry into political life among these New Americans?. Method: Using a unique survey data set that includes an oversample of first- and second-generation immigrants who have enrolled in civic leadership trainings, we examine the similarities and differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant leaders. Results: We find that immigrants are in many ways similar to their nonimmigrant counterparts in that access to structural resources help shape their political ambition. Yet immigrants, unlike their nonimmigrant counterparts, often have less of these resources and perceive their ability to capitalize on these resources as less feasible. Conclusions: We find that the traditional barriers to office—lack of professional and political experiences, finances, and monied networks—all contribute to lower self-perceived qualifications for office among both immigrants and nonimmigrants. Yet, the New American leaders who are highly politically involved, deeply rooted in their communities, and well-positioned to run for office face the additional psychological barriers posed by their race and ethnicity, immigrant identity, citizenship status, language ability, and acculturation, barriers that are often offered in open-ended essays as self-evident and crippling. Leadership training programs play a crucial role in providing training and instilling confidence in would-be immigrant candidates.},

Laws and regulations literature identifies eight criteria that may be considered when determining the boundaries of CDs and this article focuses on one of those criteria, maintaining communities of interest (COIs). This criterion requires states to preserve these boundaries when delineating CDs but fails to define a COI.

In addition to reviewing the literature, I argue that extant models should pay more explicit attention to secondary mobilization (conducted by interest groups, activists, and ordinary voters). Second, how do electoral rules regulating the electoral calendar and vote fusion affect mobilizational spillovers and, hence, incentives to build mobilizational alliances?

abstract = {The elevated levels of party polarization observed in the contemporary Congress have been attributed to a variety of factors. One of the more commonly recurring themes among observers of congressional politics is that changes in district boundaries resulting from the redistricting process are a root cause. Using a new data set linking congressional districts from 1962 to 2002, we offer a direct test of this claim. Our results show that although there is an overall trend of increasing polarization, districts that have undergone significant changes as a result of redistricting have become even more polarized. Although the effect is relatively modest, it suggests that redistricting is one among other factors that produce party polarization in the House and may help to explain the elevated levels of polarization in the House relative to the Senate.},

abstract = {A fundamental divide has emerged over how portfolio payoffs are distributed among parties in parliamentary coalitions. On one side lies very strong empirical evidence that the parties in a governing coalition tend to receive portfolios in one-to-one proportion to the amount of legislative support they contribute to the coalition, with perhaps some slight deviations from proportionality coming at the expense of larger parties that lead coalition negotiations. On the other side of the debate lies a stream of formal theories that suggest the opposite – that parties in charge of coalition negotiations ought to be able to take a disproportionately large share of portfolio benefits for themselves. In this article, we address this disjuncture by re-examining the empirical connection between legislative seats and portfolio payoffs with the aid of a new and more extensive dataset, a different method of analysis, and what we see as a more valid operationalization of the dependent variable. This operationalization involves the inclusion, for the first time, of evidence concerning the importance or salience of the portfolios each party receives, as opposed to just their quantity. The article concludes with an assessment of the implications of our findings for the debate over the rewards of coalition membership in parliamentary democracies.},

This study documents states' administrative and judicial responses to the rule and tests if states circumvent the rule by increasing fees instead of taxes.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Redrawing congressional districts in the United States is a constitu- tionally required, yet politically controversial, task undertaken after each decennial census. Federal law requires contiguous, ‘relatively compact' congressional districts that maintain ‘approximately equal' population. Controversy is introduced when individual states redraw their districts, or redistrict, using partisan committees. States such as Ohio continue to redistrict with a committee appointed according to the current proportion of legislators' political parties to the whole. When political parties have majority power in redistricting committees, they can draw districts in a way that gives their party the best chance to keep its majority representation, a process called gerrymandering. Mathematical redistricting models seek an unbiased computational approach to the problem. Rather than trust partisan committees, mathematical modeling approaches rely upon well-defined methods in computational geometry, graph theory, game theory, and other fields. Here, we discuss two such approaches. The first, given as a background for comparison, constructs Voronoi diagrams to redistrict states into convex polygons, which are generally considered ‘compact'. We give greater emphasis to a new model that discretizes a state's popu- lation and partitions it into regions of approximately equal population. This model, our main focus, relies upon graph partitioning to achieve the desired result and uses census population data as the sole parameter in redistricting.},

The resources considered are time, money, and civic skills—those communications and organizational capacities that are essential to political activity. These skills are not only acquired early in life but developed in the nonpolitical institutional settings of adult life: the workplace, organizations, and churches and synagogues. These resources are distributed differentially among groups defined by socioeconomic status. A two-stage least squares analysis shows these resources have powerful effects on overall political activity, thus explaining why socioeconomic status has traditionally been so powerful in predicting participation. We disaggregate overall activity into three kinds of acts: those that involve giving time, those that entail donating money, and voting. Each requires a different configuration of resources resulting in different patterns of stratification across various political acts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The theoretical literature on distributive politics, how- ever, focuses almost exclusively on a centralized, top-down view of policy distribution. By examining the role of presidents, legislators, and bureaucrats, scholars have ignored participants who have become key actors in the distribution of federal expenditures-the recipient jurisdictions. This analysis of the allocation patterns under six federal pro- grams shows that local governments exert important influences on the distribution of federal grants and that the distributional patterns and their determinants vary over time. The analysis also points out the importance of disaggregation by focusing on programs and recipient jurisdictions, as opposed to total federal expenditures and regions, states, or congressional districts.},

In our model, one parameter reflects an effect that generally acts to increase turnout as the effective number of parties increases, another an effect that generally acts to decrease turnout as the effective number of parties increases, while a third parameter allows for baseline variation in turnout across countries (or within countries across elections). We fit this model to district-level data from 237 elections held in 17 countries, representing a wide range of electoral system types generating multi-party contests, with over 20,000 district-election observations. The basic intuition, that turnout rises to a peak as the effective number of parties increases and then falls slowly, fits our data pretty well.},

abstract = {Despite recent setbacks, litigation-based challenges to extreme partisan gerrymandering continue, and quantitative methods for detection are more important than ever. Many measurement tools have emerged that probe the question of whether a redistricting map is extreme or violates the principle of partisan symmetry. Such tools were used successfully in a lawsuit concerning Pennsylvania congressional districts under that state's constitution. Here we provide a framework for categorizing these tests for future use in state and federal constitutional cases. Our framework explains how measures should be interpreted and identifies which tests will be most effective given the specific facts of a particular state. Broadly, the tests can be divided into two categories: those that identify inequality of opportunity, i.e., a systematic effort to deprive of a group's ability to elect representatives; and those that identify inequality of outcome, i.e., a durable distortion in the amount of representation. In each case, the measures examine the difference between the existing map and what would occur under a districting process in which partisan interests are not the overriding consideration. A general thread is that of ''significance testing,'' in which a district or statewide districting scheme can be defined as more extreme than the great majority of possibilities that could arise through unbiased means. Such tests are most often done with well-established classical statistical tests but can also include recently developed measures such as the efficiency gap. It is even now possible to evaluate, with mathematical rigor, whether a specific scheme is extreme relative to the virtually uncountable universe of possible maps. Taken together, these methods for detecting extremes comprise a statistical toolbox to address a wide variety of circumstances that may arise in any of the 50 states.},

However, the asymmetry standard is only a broad statement of principle, and no analytical method for assessing asymmetry has yet been held to be manageable. Recently I proposed (68 Stanford Law Review 1263) three statistical tests to reliably assess asymmetry in state-level districting schemes: (a) a discrepancy in winning vote margins between the two parties' seats; (b) undue reliable wins for the party in charge of redistricting, as measured by the mean-median difference in vote share, or by an unusually even distribution of votes across districts; and (c) unrepresentative distortion in the number of seats won based on expectations from nationwide district characteristics. These tests use district-level election outcomes, do not require the drawing of maps, and are accessible via nearly any desktop computer. Each test probes a facet of partisan asymmetry. The first two tests analyze intent using well-established, century-old statistical tests. Once intents are established, the effects of gerrymandering can be analyzed using the third test, which is calculated rapidly by computer simulation.

This populist bias of policy is greater when the value of remaining in office is higher for the politician; when there is greater polarization between the policy preferences of the median voter and right-wing special interests; when politicians are perceived as more likely to be corrupt; when there is an intermediate amount of noise in the information that voters receive; when politicians are more forward-looking; and when there is greater uncertainty about the type of the incumbent.

This was two less than Pennsylvania's previous allotment and therefore necessitated a thorough redrawing of their congressional district boundaries. The Republican Party held sizable majorities in the state legislature and controlled the governorship, and therefore had solid control of the redistricting process. Republicans took full advantage of their fortuitous situation by pursuing an aggressive partisan gerrymander. Their efforts were supported and cheered on by national party operatives including White House senior advisor Karl Rove (Barone and Cohen 2003, 1351). The resulting map eliminated four Democratic},

The basic assumption is that efficiency is optimized when the number of communication channels within the assembly equals the number of interest aggregation channels in each constituency. Adult literacy is taken as a measure of social mobilization. This leads to the equation A = (2LWP0)13N where A is the assembly size, LW is the fraction of literate adults in the total population P0, and N is a term representing the effects of all other factors. For the model to be valid, the world-wide average of log N should be zero, and its range should be small compared to the range of log A. This is so, indeed.},

abstract = {Thanks to the availability of new historical census sources and advances in record linking technology, economic historians are becoming big data geneal-ogists. Linking individuals over time and between databases has opened up new avenues for research into intergenerational mobility, the long run effects of early life conditions, assimilation, discrimination, and the returns to education. To take advantage of these new research opportunities, scholars need to be able to accurately and efficiently match historical records and produce an unbiased dataset of links for analysis. I detail a standard and transparent census matching technique for constructing linked samples that can be repli-cated across a variety of cases. The procedure applies insights from machine learning classification and text comparison to record linkage of historical data. My method teaches an algorithm to replicate how a well trained and consistent researcher would create a linked sample across sources. I begin by extracting a subset of possible matches for each record, and then use training data to tune a matching algorithm that attempts to minimize both false positives and false negatives, taking into account the inherent noise in historical records. To make the procedure precise, I trace its application to an example from my own work, linking children from the 1915 Iowa State Census to their adult-selves in the 1940 Federal Census. In addition, I provide guidance on a number of practical questions, including how large the training data needs to be relative to the sample.},

Hypotheses about relationships between a number of static and dynamic achievement discrepancy constructs (labeled “relative gratification,” and built from a variant of the Cantril Self-Anchoring scale) are tested. The achievement discrepancy constructs generally show only a weak degree of association with potential for political violence. However, measures of shift over time in discrepancy show an unexpected and intriguing relationship with potential for political violence: individuals who perceive negative change and individuals who perceive positive change show the highest potential for political violence, while individuals who perceive no change show the lowest potential for political violence; and this V -Curve relationship persists in the presence of various control variables. Moreover, absolute magnitude of shift in discrepancy from present to future shows a moderate degree of correlation with potential for political violence, and makes an independent contribution to a linear additive model. The data base is a sample of a population in which instances of political violence have been relatively frequent in the past.},

We specifically examine how these factors differ for respondents living in various types of American urban, suburban, and rural areas. Arguably, in the aftermath of the 2016 Presidential election, public opinion toward often racialized immigration policy proposals is incomplete without an understanding of the role of place and geographic identity. In the 2016 general election, 62 percent of rural voters cast a ballot for Trump, as compared with 50 percent of suburban voters, and 35 percent of urban voters. However, we know little about how their views toward undocumented immigration, a persistent hot-button issue, varied by geographic type. Our findings suggest that views toward undocumented immigrants currently living and working in the United States are conditioned by factors related to a respondent?s geographic type. We find that attitudes toward immigrants vary considerably across place. These findings provide support to our argument about the development of a geographic-based identity that has considerable impact on important public opinion attitudes, even after controlling for more traditional explanatory factors.},

Using new panel measures of democratic mood varying over 135 countries and up to 30 years, this article finds little evidence for such a positive feedback effect of democracy on support. Instead, it demonstrates a negative thermostatic effect: increases in democracy depress democratic mood, while decreases cheer it. Moreover, it is increases in the liberal, counter-majoritarian aspects of democracy, not the majoritarian, electoral aspects that provoke this backlash from citizens. These novel results challenge existing research on support for democracy, but also reconcile this research with the literature on macro-opinion.},

The market-like model described points to an efficient way of dividing the provision of public goods across jurisdictions. The residents of each jurisdiction will pay for the benefits they receive, and get the selection of services they want. However, matters of distribution, which are an essential part of the tax and expenditure process are left out. In practice, decentralized redistribution policy can only operate within narrow limits. Any jurisdiction which unilaterally imposes higher taxes at the upper end of the scale invites the loss of mobile resources, including both capital and high- income residents. Conversely, jurisdictions which unilaterally offer greater benefits to the poor will attract outsiders to share in the benefits. A further issue in the division of functions involves the role of macro policy, in its monetary and fiscal forms.},

abstract = {Why do regional institutions emerge, what accounts for their variation in design, and what are their effects? Several conceptual and epistemological perspectives—neorealism, neoliberal-institutionalism, constructivism, and domestic politics—provide competing and complementary answers to these questions. I focus on regional organizations as productive arenas for developing contingent propositions on institutions more generally. The purpose is to advance cross-paradigmatic dialogue in two ways: through sensitivity to scope conditions and to institutional genesis, forms, and effects, in an effort to transcend axiomatic debates that often conflate different dependent variables. The empirical analysis includes the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Arab League. The main findings from these cases suggest that understanding the nature of dominant domestic coalitions is often crucial for explaining incentives to create, design, and fine-tune the effects of institutions. However, this is mainly the case when the consequences of creating or designing institutions for power distribution, transaction costs, and norms are negligible or hard to estimate. In many cases these consequences are sizeable, reducing the explanatory influence of domestic coalitions. The latter often provide no more than permissive conditions for the emergence, design, and effect of institutions. Their influence is most decisive in explaining institutional genesis but is often underdetermining in explaining their design.},

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature - defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all. Because real-world redistricting and gerrymandering involve complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.},

abstract = {"One man, one vote" may be a familiar democratic motto, but it hardly applies to American presidential elections. That's because of the United States' bizarre electoral college system, which makes it possible for candidates who finish second in the popular vote to triumph in the electoral count. In fact, this has happened at least twice (1876 and 1888). On two other occasions (1800 and 1824), the House of Representatives picked the president when nobody won an electoral-college majority. Thomas Jefferson once described this circumstance as "the most dangerous blot on our Constitution." In the brief but comprehensive Electoral College Primer 2000, Lawrence D. Longley and Neal R. Peirce show why Jefferson's assessment was right on target. They have a keen understanding of the electoral college's vulnerabilities. Through a few simple calculations, for example, they show that Californians have more than two-and-a-half times the voting power of Montana residents. More alarming, however, they describe how a small shift in the popular vote can enact a huge change in the electoral college outcome. They count 22 "hairbreadth elections" in American history, including the 1960 race between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon--if 8,971 votes in Illinois and Missouri had switched from Kennedy to Nixon that year, the result would have been an electoral college deadlock. It's amazing the system has held up as well as it has over the years; Longley and Peirce persuasively argue that it's only a matter of time before it breaks down completely. --John J. Miller},

We rely on a massive field experiment from the 2014 Texas gubernatorial campaign to assess the individual, synergistic, and collective impact of a variety of outreach modes on the electorate. The data demonstrate some durable synergistic and overall campaign effects on voters' attitudes toward the sponsoring candidate, with lesser effects on turnout.

Further, differences between adolescents who do and do not have access to, or self-select into, middle school dance electives have yet to be identified. We prospectively followed a large (n = 31,332), ethnically diverse sample of children from preschool through 8th grade in Miami, Florida. About 7{\%} of adolescents enrolled in a dance elective course at some point in middle school (6th–8th grade), with the majority of those (68.8{\%}) taking dance for only one year. Black students were more likely than White and Latinx students to attend middle schools that did not offer dance. When dance courses were available, males and Black students were less likely to select into a dance elective. Students who took dance in middle school showed greater initial social skills at age four and better prior academic achievement in elementary school compared with those who did not take dance. Importantly, controlling for all preexisting selection effects and prior academic achievement, dance engagement in middle school was associated with higher grade point averages and standardized test scores, better school attendance, and a lower likelihood of suspension during middle school, with stronger positive effects observed for taking dance electives for multiple years.

abstract = {Every decade, states redraw congressional maps after the decennial census. Redistricting allows districts to be rebalanced, ensuring in theory that all districts are both equally populated and representative. But redistricting also provides an enormous opportunity for politicians: the chance to redraw a district map means the opportunity to gerrymander and to manipulate a map to create a more favorable set of districts for themselves and for their party. Congressional maps were last redrawn en masse after the 2010 Census, and accusations of gerrymandering in states nationwide soon followed. Complaints about redistricting abuses ran the gamut from allegations that some maps had been drawn to favor incumbents to outrage at the sprawling and unnatural shapes of districts in others. This report focuses on one of the most egregious of these abuses: the manipulation of district lines to give the party drawing the map a share of seats grossly at odds with statewide election results, thus ensuring that one party is overrepresented and the other underrepresented in a delegation. To gauge where this type of gerrymandering is taking place and its magnitude, this report used election results in states with six or more congressional districts to assess the extent and the durability of “partisan bias” — the degree of systematic advantage one party receives over another in turning votes into seats. For this analysis, this report used multiple quantitative measures of partisan bias to examine the 2012, 2014, and 2016 congressional elections. It also looked at the relationship between the body that drew the maps and the degree of bias observed. It is among the first analyses to use 2016 electoral data to examine maps, and the first report of its kind to measure maps using multiple measures of bias and to identify the handful of},

abstract = {The apparent decline in voter participation in national elections since 1972 is an illusion created by using the Bureau of the Census estimate of the voting-age population as the denominator of the turnout rate. We construct a more accurate estimate of those eligible to vote, from 1948-2000, using government statistical series to adjust for ineligible but included groups, such as noncitizens and felons, and eligible but excluded groups, such as overseas citizens. We show that the ineligible population, not the nonvoting, has been increasing since 1972. During the 1960s the turnout rate trended downward both nationally and outside the South. Although the average turnout rates for presidential and congressional elections are lower since 1972 than during 1948-70, the only pattern since 1972 is an increased turnout rate in southern congressional elections. While the voting age was lowered to 18 in 1971, the lower turnout rate of of young voters accounts for less than one-fourth of reduced voter participation.},

We further show that party cues exert powerful effects on nonpolitical judgments and behaviors. Partisans discriminate against opposing partisans, doing so to a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race.We note that the willingness of partisans to display open animus for opposing partisans can be attributed to the absence of norms governing the expression of negative sentiment and that increased partisan affect provides an incentive for elites to engage in confrontation rather than cooperation.},

@article{King1989,
abstract = {This paper builds a stochastic model of the processes that give rise to observed patterns of representation and bias in congressional and state legislative elections. The analysis demonstrates that partisan swing and incumbency voting, concepts from the congressional elections literature, have determinate effects on representation and bias, concepts from the redistrictihg literature. The model shows precisely how incumbency and increased variability of partisan swing reduce the responsive- ness of the electoral system and how partisan swing affects whether the system is biased toward one party or the other. Incumbency, and other causes of unresponsive representation, also reduce the effect of partisan swing on current levels of partisan bias. By relaxing the restrictive portions of the widely applied "uniform partisan swing" assump- tion, the theoretical analysis leads directly to an empirical model enabling one more reliably to estimate responsiveness and bias from a single year of electoral data. Applying this to data from seven elections in each of six states, the paper demonstrates that redistricting has effects in predicted directions in the short run: partisan gerrymandering biases the system in favor of the party in control and, by freeing up seats held by opposition party incumbents, increases the system's responsiveness. Bipartisan-controlled redistricting appears to reduce bias somewhat and dramatically to reduce re- sponsiveness. Nonpartisan redistricting processes substantially increase responsiveness but do not have as clear an effect on bias. However, after only two elections, prima facie evidence for redistrict- ing effects evaporate in most states. Finally, across every state and type of redistricting process, responsiveness declined significantly over the course of the decade. This is clear evidence that the phenomenon of "vanishing marginals," recognized first in the U.S. Congress literature, also applies to these different types of state legislative assemblies. It also strongly suggests that redistricting could not account for this pattern. 1.},

abstract = {A standard method for correcting for unequal sampling probabilities and nonresponse in sample surveys is poststrati?cation: that is, dividing the population into several categories, estimating the distribution of responses in each category, and then counting each category in proportion to its size in the population. We consider poststrati?cation as a general framework that includes many weighting schemes used in survey analysis (see Little, 1993). We construct a hierarchical logistic regression model for the mean of a binary response variable conditional on poststrati?cation cells. The hierarchical model allows us to ?t many more cells than is possible using classical methods, and thus to include much more population-level information, while at the same time including all the information used in standard survey sampling inferences. We are thus combining the modeling approach often used in small-area estimation with the population information used in poststrati?cation. We apply the method to a set of U.S. pre-election polls, poststrati?ed by state as well as the usual demographic variables. We evaluate the models graphically by comparing to state-level election outcomes.},

@article{Yitzhaki1983,
abstract = {In his seminal 1970 paper, Atkinson suggested an index of inequality that makes it possible to measure inequality under different value judgements. The value judgement is expressed by specifying a parameter, s, which ranges from zero, representing indifference to inequality, to infinity, representing the Rawlsian criterion, which evaluates distributions according to the income of the poorest in the society. The Gini coefficient is a popular and widely used index for measuring inequality. It can be presented geometrically by the Lorenz curve but unlike Atkinson's index it does not explicitly express the value judgement underlying it. The aim of this paper is to explore a parametric variant of the Gini coefficient suggested by Kakwani [1980], who derived it as an extension of Sen's [1976a] measure of poverty. Using different assumptions, Donaldson and Weymark [1980], [1981] have suggested the same index. In particular, I show that this extension has most of the properties of Atkinson's index. Its main advantage over the latter is that it can be expressed as a function of the Lorenz curve, and some of the results of economic applications of the Lorenz curve (Kakwani [1977], Jakobsson [1976]) can therefore easily be translated into the parametric Gini index. The first section defi.nes the parametric Gini index and explores its merits, in the second section the relation between it and the Lorenz curve is discussed; in the third section, the effect of changing the parameter is discussed, while the fourth section compares the Gini with the Atkinson index. 1 Let F (y), f(y) represent the cumulative income distribution and the density function, respectively. Assume that the range of the income distribution is bounded, that is, there exists a ?0 and b {\textless} oo such that F(a) = 0 and F(b) = 1.

the same host cell, whereas at low multiplicities the viruses

abstract = {Objectives: We offer a typology of possible reforms to the Electoral College (EC) in terms of changes to its two most important structural features: seat allocations that are not directly proportional to population and winner-take-all outcomes at the state level. This typology allows us to classify four major variants of “reform” to the present EC in a parsimonious fashion. Many of the proposals we consider have been suggested by well-known figures, some debated in Congress, and they include what we view as most likely to be taken seriously. We evaluate these proposals solely in terms of one simple criterion: “Would they be expected to reduce the likelihood of inversions between EC and popular vote outcomes?”. Methods: We answer this question by looking at the data on actual presidential election outcomes at the state level over the entire period 1868–2016, and at the congressional-district level over the period 1956–2016. We consider the implications for presidential outcomes of these different alternative mechanisms, in comparison to the actual electoral outcome and the popular vote outcome. In addition, we consider the implications of a proposal to increase the size of the U.S. House (Ladewig and Jasinski, 2008). Results: Our results show that inversions from the popular vote happen under all proposed alternatives at nearly the same rate as under the current EC rules, with some proposals actually making inversions more frequent. Conclusions: The major difference between the present EC rule and alternative rules is not in frequency of inversions, but is in which particular years the inversions occur. As for the proposal to increase the size of the House, we show that any realistic increase in House size would have made no difference for the 2016 outcome.},

Making use of 12 different criteria, we evaluate 19 indices that have been previously proposed as measures of either disproportionality of electoral seats–votes results or over-time volatility of party vote (or seat) shares. We suggest that, on balance, Gallagher's (1991) index, which has achieved increasing acceptance in the seats–votes literature on disproportionality (see esp. Lijphart, 1994) offers the most desirable combination of features, although the advantages it offers over the Loosemore-Hanby index are not large and are debatable. We also find that Dalton's principle of transfers presents an ambiguity when one party has a larger number of excess seats, while another has a larger propor...},

abstract = {Many U.S. states require redistricting authorities to follow traditional districting principles (TDPs) like the creation of compact districts and respecting the integrity of county and town boundaries. Reformers, academics, and other redistricting experts have long suggested that following such districting principles may enhance representation. Yet, very few academic studies have empirically examined these expectations. Using two measures of geographical compactness and a new measure of respect for political subdivisions (referred to as coterminosity) created with a geographic information system (GIS), the connection between district boundaries and representation is tested. The results show strong evidence that the use of geographic districting principles can enhance dyadic representation, as more compact and more coterminous districts are associated with more positive evaluations of legislative responsiveness and greater citizen-representative communication. Violating TDPs to advance other goals in redistricting like strict population equality between districts thus comes with a clear representational cost. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

Yet, the close association of local powers with local boundaries generates spillovers, fiscal disparities, and interlocal conflicts. Real local autonomy is constrained but the local gov- ernment system fails to provide a means for addressing regional problems. Public choice theorists and political decentralizationists oppose regional gov- ernments because of the threat to local autonomy that would result from re- moving powers from local hands. Richard Briffault's solution to the metropolitan governance problem is a "mixed strategy" that would both re- duce the significance of existing local boundaries and create elected regionally bounded governments to address matters of regional significance. In his re- gime, small local governments would remain units for local decisionmaking. But regional political institutions, with regional land use and fiscal powers, would provide an opportunity for regionwide deliberation, popular participa- tion in decisions of regional significance, and the framing and implementation of policies addressed to the needs of the region as a wh},

abstract = {As most political scientists know, the outcome of the American presidential election can be predicted within a few percentage points (in the popular vote), based on information available months before the election. Thus, the general campaign for president seems irrelevant to the outcome (except in very close elections), despite all the media coverage of campaign strategy. However, it is also well known that the pre-election opinion polls can vary wildly over the campaign, and this variation is generally attributed to events in the campaign. How can cam-paign events affect people's opinions on whom they plan to vote for, and yet not affect the outcome of the election? For that matter, why do voters consistently increase their rupport for a candidate during his nominating convention, even though the conventions are almost entirely predictable events whose effects can be rationally forecast? In this exploratory study, we consider several intuitively appealing, but ultimately wrong. resolutions to this puzzle and discuss our current understanding of what causes opinion polls to fluctuate while reaching a predictable outcome. Our evidence is based on graphical presen-tation and analysis of over 67,000 individual-level responses from forty-nine commercial polls during the 1988 campaign and many other aggregate poll results from the 1952-92campaigns. We show that responses to pollsters during the campaign are not generally informed or even, in a sense we describe, 'rational'. In contrast, voters decide, based on their enlightened preferences, as formed by the information they have learned during the campaign, as wel! as basic political cues such as ideology and party identification, which candidate to support eventually. We cannot prove this conclusion, but we do show that it is consistent with the aggregate forecasts and individual-level opinion poll responses. Based on the enlightened prefer-ences hypothesis, we conclude that the news media have an important effect on the outcome of presidential elections -not through misleading advertisements. sound bites, or spin doctors, but rather by conveying candidates' positions on important issues. Something is amiss in the scholarly study of American presidential elections. For some time now, political scientists have forecast the outcome of presidential elections accurately using only information available before the start of the general election campaign. However, the numerous 'trial heat' public opinion surveys (polls about whether likely voters plan to cast their ballots for the Democratic or Republican candidate for president) conducted during the campaign vary enormously in support for the Democratic and Republican},

In the 1970s and 1980s, counties tended to become more competitive, but by 1996 a pattern of partisan sorting had emerged and continued through the present.

An exception is the election of 1888. We show that Trump's victory in 2016 is like Harrison's in 1888 and unlike Hayes's in 1876 and Bush's in 2000.

The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of LWV for future partisan gerrymandering litigation. In particular, we look toward the applicability of the Pennsylvania court's approach to other potential partisan gerrymandering challenges brought under state law, especially those in the 12 states whose state constitutions have provisions essentially identical to the one relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in states with similar provisions. We pay particular attention to how the court made use of the expert witness testimony in the case, relying on some of it, while rejecting or critiquing the applicability of other elements, since such a discussion can inform future litigation in state courts drawing on the LWV opinion for ideas. In our concluding discussion we contrast the criteria used to evaluate partisan gerrymandering by this court with those used by federal courts, and we look at how it may impact the decisions of legislators about line drawing in 2020.},

Methods: Bring both original and secondary sources to bear on the problem of partisan gerrymandering, through the examination of election results under them, and federal and state court reactions to them. Results: Evidence shows that gerrymandering in seven states accounted for the Republican Party's manufactured majority in the U.S. House of Representatives following the 2012 election, and that it took judicial intervention by courts in some states and the Democratic wave election of 2018 to loosen the grip of those gerrymanders to undo that “spurious” majority. Conclusion: The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 2019 to withdraw federal courts from partisan gerrymandering litigation, just as the district courts were proving themselves able to deal with the issue in a nonpartisan and effective manner, is likely to result in another decade of extensive and excessive gerrymandering in the United States.},

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature - defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all.

abstract = {Redistricting poses a potential harm to American voters in limiting choice and accountability at the polls. Although voters still technically retain their right to contact their congressional representatives in order to seek redress for their concerns, we argue that the confusion created when redistricting divides ZIP Codes confounds the constituent-representative link and leaves a substantive minority of voters in representational limbo. ZIP Codes perform a functional role by organizing groups of residents into easily accessible blocs for mail service. However, congressional districts split the ZIP Codes of over 100 million Americans. Splitting ZIP Codes across multiple congressional districts leads to constituents being confused about who their member is and greater inefficiencies for representatives to mail to their constituents. Additionally, several members of Congress actively ignore out-of-district mail. We posit that constituents from ZIP Codes split by multiple congressional districts will be less likely to recognize, contact, or ideologically identify with their representative. We conducted a population overlap analysis between ZIP Codes and congressional districts to determine the impact of splitting ZIP Codes on a battery of items on the Cooperative Congressional Election Survey (CCES) from 2008-2016. Our analysis provides evidence that splitting ZIP Codes across multiple congressional districts impairs the constituent-representative link. Finally, we demonstrate the preservation of ZIP Codes in redistricting is feasible and produces a substantive reduction in partisan bias.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In ethnic and racial terms, America is growing rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial threat hypotheses to today's immigrants have generated inconsistent results. This article develops the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative that focuses on how national and local conditions interact to construe immigrants as threatening. Hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants are most likely when communities undergo sudden influxes of immigrants and when salient national rhetoric reinforces the threat. Data from several sources, including twelve geocoded surveys from 1992 to 2009, provide consistent support for this approach. Time-series cross-sectional and panel data allow the analysis to exploit exogenous shifts in salient national issues such as the September 11 attacks, reducing the problem of residential self-selection and other threats to validity. The article also tests the hypothesis using new data on local anti-immigrant policies. By highlighting the interaction of local and national conditions, the politicized places hypothesis can explain both individual attitudes and local political outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Public policies that shape geographic space have been a major contributor to this geographic polarization. This article examines the effect of the Interstate Highway System, the largest public works project in American history, on this phenomenon. Drawing on a database of US highway construction since the passage of 1956 highway legislation, it shows that suburban Interstate highways made suburban counties less Democratic, especially in the South and where highways were built earlier. Metropolitan areas with denser Interstate networks also became more polarized. Analysis of the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study (1965–97) reveals individual-level mechanisms underlying these changes: Interstates drew more white and affluent residents, who tended to be Republican, to the suburbs},

We find a reduction in white contributions to black Democrats, and to black and Latino Republicans, but little difference in overall fundraising competitiveness. Although we cannot definitively rule out alternative mechanisms that covary with candidate ethnorace, the results suggest that the nomination of minority candidates can increase the ethnoracial representativeness of campaign finance without costs to fundraising.},

abstract = {Republican candidates often receive between 30{\%} and 40{\%} of the two-way vote share in statewide elections in Massachusetts. For the last three Census cycles, MA has held 9-10 seats in the House of Representatives, which means that a district can be won with as little as 6{\%} of the statewide vote. Putting these two facts together, it is striking that a Massachusetts Republican has not won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives since 1994. We argue that the underperfor-mance of Republicans in Massachusetts is not attributable to gerrymandering, nor to the failure of Republicans to field House candidates, but is a structural mathematical feature of the actual distribution of votes observable in some recent elections. Several of these elections have a remarkable property in their vote patterns: Republican votes clear 30{\%}, but are distributed so uniformly that they are locked out of the possibility of representation. Though there are more ways of building a valid districting plan than there are particles in the galaxy, every single one of them would produce a 9-0 Democratic delegation.},

abstract = {The question of whether increased electoral turnout would make a difference has long been a matter of interest to psephologists and laymen alike. Several approaches to this question have been employed, one of which has been an analysis of responses to survey questions about how non-voters would have voted had they actually voted. The problem with this approach is not only that it involves responses to a hypothetical question, but also that the responses are given after the election outcome is known and hence are subject to the impact of various post-election effects - "bandwagon effects" in particular. In the present article an alternative approach based on an analysis of party sympathy scores is pursued. Party sympathy scores are calculated among voters and non-voters alike. On the basis of this information, an algorithm is then used to estimate what percentage of potential voters were "lost" by the failure of different parties to mobilize non-voters with sympathy scores comparable to their voters, and thereby assess the impact of non-voting on the election outcome. Analyses are carried out using data from six national parliamentary elections held in Norway in the period from 1981 to 2001. Results indicate that the impact of higher levels of turnout is marginal at best. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Immigration and demographic change have become highly salient in American politics, partly because of the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump. Previous research indicates that local influxes of immigrants or unfamiliar ethnic groups can generate threatened responses, but has either focused on nonelectoral outcomes or analyzed elections in large geographic units, such as counties. Here, we examine whether demographic changes at low levels of aggregation were associated with vote shifts toward an anti-immigration presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. To do so, we compile a precinct-level dataset of election results and demographic measures for almost 32,000 precincts in the states of Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We employ regression analyses varying model specifications and measures of demographic change. Our estimates uncover little evidence that influxes of Hispanics or noncitizen immigrants benefited Trump relative to past Republicans, instead consistently showing that such changes were associated with shifts to Trump's opponent. demographic change | US presidential voting | precinct-level analysis | voter file data H ow is increasing ethnic and racial diversity reshaping the electoral politics of advanced industrial democracies? Recent elections in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and elsewhere have brought this question to the foreground, as candidates and parties have found success while amplifying concerns about immigration and demographic change (1-3). Some scholars contend that growing ethnic and racial diversity has the potential to upend traditional political divisions over economic issues by realigning voting patterns on the basis of ethnicity, nativity, nationalism, and education (4-6). At first glance, Donald Trump's unexpected 2016 victory seems consistent with this trend: His support was related to his outspoken opposition to immigration (7). Even so, the hypothesis that increasing ethnic and racial diversity fuels support for Trump and other populist, anti-immigration candidates is difficult to test empirically. While advanced industrial democracies have grown more ethnically and racially diverse in recent decades, they have also experienced other large social and economic changes, such as greater exposure to international trade and declining economic prospects for the less educated. These changes provide alternative explanations for the success of populist and anti-immigration politicians. Unfortunately, 1-time shifts in overall national election results provide little leverage to disentangle multiple simultaneous causes. Instead, scholars interested in the effects of changing demo-graphics and ethnicity have sometimes considered local-level variation. Because the United States is a large and diverse country , some localities have seen substantial influxes of immigrants and/or associated pan-ethnic groups, while many others have not. Studying responses to local demographic changes thus provides substantially increased statistical power with which to address 1 specific set of hypotheses about demographic change and voters' lived experiences in their communities. Local demographic changes are critical in certain theories of anti-immigration attitudes. Local population changes are better measures of the local, community-level experiences that individuals have in their everyday lives (see especially refs. 8-13). Indeed, prior work on the United States finds that local demographic changes are associated with a range of outcomes, including anti-immigration attitudes, hate crimes, increased voter turnout, and opposition to antidiscrimination laws and local bond measures (refs. 13-20, with ref. 20 a meta-analysis spanning developed democracies). Research on the United Kingdom has found that support for Brexit, the UK Independence Party, and reducing immigration are higher in localities that have low immigrant shares but recent demographic changes (21-23), with related research in continental Europe (24, 25). To date, though, there has been less research on the overall impact of local demographic changes on American partisan election outcomes. The importance of partisan attachments to voting, combined with growing elite polarization, may limit the capacity of local immigration concerns to shape elections. In addition, despite its disparate local impacts, immigration may be a symbolic, nationalized issue whose effects do not depend on local experiences. While prior research has focused overwhelmingly on the negative reactions of native-born Americans in receiving communities, it is also possible that the average citizen may react positively, even while some Significance In recent years, advanced industrial democracies have grown more ethnically and racially diverse. This increasing diversity has the potential to reshape voting behavior in those countries, in part because majority groups may react by shifting support toward anti-immigration candidates and parties. This paper considers whether local demographic changes in the United States were associated with pro-Republican shifts between 2012 and 2016, when the Republican presidential candidate was especially outspoken in opposition to immigration. By showing that demographic changes were not associated with shifts toward the Republican , this research indicates that local demographic changes are not on their own increasing support for anti-immigration candidates.},

The three components of the 'faulty' votes that we identify under PR are (a) spoilt votes, (b) votes for the candidate or party only because it listed as No. 1 on the ballot, and (c) votes for candidates listed as No. 1 on party lists in PR elections (the effect does not occur in SMD).

abstract = {In the aftermath of Donald Trump's 2016 electoral-college victory, journalists focused heavily on the White working class (WWC) and the relationship between economic anxiety, racial attitudes, immigration attitudes, and support for Trump. One hypothesized but untested proposition for Donald Trump's success is that his unorthodox candidacy , particularly his rhetoric surrounding economic marginalization and immigration, shifted WWC voters who did not vote Republican in 2012 into his coalition. Using a large national survey, we examine: (1) whether racial and immigration attitudes or economic dislocation and marginality were the main correlates of vote switching; and (2) whether this phenomenon was isolated among the White working class. Findings indicate that a nontrivial number of White voters switched their votes in the 2016 election to Trump or Clinton, that this vote switching was more associated with racial and immigration attitudes than economic factors, and that the phenomenon occurred among both working-class and nonworking-class Whites, though many more working-class Whites switched than did nonworking-class Whites. Our findings suggest that racial and immigration attitudes may be continuing to sort White voters into new partisan camps and further polarize the parties.},

We illustrate empirically that the volatility of the pivot points has increased markedly since the mid 1970s, and we link changes in pivot volatility to the degree of party polarization. In general, median and supermajority pivots shift considerably more than the overall mean and, when politics is polarized, the congressional median and supermajority pivots can change dramatically when a shift in control occurs. The relative volatility of median and supermajoritarian pivots varies with the degree of polarization and the extent to which there is continuity in party control. We develop a theoretical model to explain the nature of these relationships.},

First, we examine whether battleground states received more media spending and visits by the candidates and their party committees compared to nonbattleground states. Second. we examine whether media spending and candidate visits were related to state-level turnout. The results of the project show that the battleground states did receive significantly more media expenditures and candidate visits from the two major party campaigns than nonbattleground states. Furthermore, when controlling for state-level contextual and political factors, the more media expenditures and candidate visits a state received the higher the state turnout. Finally, the analysis reveals that state battleground status indirectly impacted state-level turnout through its effect on media spending and candidate visits.},

However, these increases may not be evenly distributed across the electorate and could potentially increase the differences between voters and nonvoters. By analyzing individual level-data, we reassess previous GOTV experiments to determine which interventions mobilize under-represented citizens versus those who regularly turn out. We develop a generalized and exportable test which indicates whether a particular intervention reduces or exacerbates disparities in political participation and apply it to 24 previous experimental interventions. On average, current mobilization strategies significantly widen disparities in participation by mobilizing high-propensity individuals more than the under-represented, low-propensity citizens. The results hold troubling implications for the study and improvement of political inequality, but the methodological procedures laid out in this study may assist the development and testing of future strategies which reverse this pattern. {\textcopyright} 2013 Southern Political Science Association.},

It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of LWV for future partisan gerrymandering litigation. In particular, we look toward the applicability of the Pennsylvania court's approach to other potential partisan gerrymandering challenges brought under state law, especially those in the 12 states whose state constitutions have provisions essentially identical to the one relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in states with similar provisions. We pay particular attention to how the court made use of the expert witness testimony in the case, relying on some of it, while rejecting or critiquing the applicability of other elements, since such a discussion can inform future litigation in state courts drawing on the LWV opinion for ideas. In our concluding discussion we contrast the criteria used to evaluate partisan gerrymandering by this court with those used by federal courts, and we look at how it may impact the decisions of legislators about line drawing in 2020.},

abstract = {Although many recent studies have examined presidential campaigns, most have con- centrated on television advertising or news media coverage as the key variables of interest. Few empirical analyses have focused on the pattern of candidate appear- ances, and almost none have considered changes in these patterns over time. This gap is intriguing because some places should tend to receive more attention than others, and yet we know very little about the electoral strategies that determine where and why candidates make appearances. We expect that presidential campaigns have increasingly emphasized visits to particular locales because these visits are critical for driving the agenda and shaping voter perceptions through local news media cov- erage. Our analysis of presidential campaign appearances at the county, media mar- ket, and state levels in general elections from 1972–2000 indicates that presidential candidate appearances are increasing both in number and in geographic scope over time. While candidate appearances are concentrated in areas with especially dense and large populations, most eligible voters live in media markets that receive at least one visit by a presidential candidate, and the percentage of eligible voters exposed to especially intense personal campaigning has been on the rise. In contrast to our expectations, our findings suggest that presidential campaign appearances have not become more narrowly focused on smaller segments of the American population},

abstract = {Political districting in the United States is a decennial process of redrawing the boundaries of congressional and state legislative districts. The notion of fairness in political districting has been an important topic of subjective debate, with district maps having consequences to multiple stakeholders. Even though districting as an optimization problem has been well-studied, existing models primarily rely on non-political fairness measures such as the compactness of districts. This paper introduces optimization models for districting with political fairness criteria. The criteria considered are based on fundamental fairness principles such as vote-seat proportionality (efficiency gap), partisan (a)symmetry, and competitiveness. Given the large sizes of practical instances, a multilevel algorithm is presented, which first reduces instance sizes by a series of graph contractions, and then solves an exact multi-objective problem at the inner level using the −constraint method. The non-linearity of the partisan asymmetry objective is efficiently tackled with the branch-and-cut method. Case studies on congressional districting in Wisconsin are presented. The results demonstrate that district plans constituting the Pareto-front are equitable, symmetric, competitive, and compact, and that a multi-objective approach is integral to paving the way towards a holistic districting process that addresses all the stakeholders.},

This article demonstrates how a straightforward redistricting algorithm can be used to generate a benchmark against which to contrast a plan that has been called into constitutional question, thus laying bare any partisan ad-vantage that cannot be attributed to legitimate legislative objectives.

abstract = {While the Supreme Court in Bandemer v. Davis found partisan gerrymandering to be justiciable, no challenged redistricting plan in the subsequent 20 years has been held unconstitutional on partisan grounds. Then, in Vieth v. Jubilerer, five justices concluded that some standard might be adopted in a future case, if a manageable rule could be found. When gerrymandering next came before the Court, in LULAC v. Perry, we along with our colleagues filed an Amicus Brief (King et al., 2005), proposing the test be based in part on the partisan symmetry standard. Although the issue was not resolved, our proposal was discussed and positively evaluated in three of the opinions, including the plurality judgment, and for the first time for any proposal the Court gave a clear indication that a future legal test for partisan gerrymandering will likely include partisan symmetry. A majority of Justices now appear to endorse the view that the measurement of partisan symmetry may be used in partisan gerrymandering claims as “a helpful (though certainly not talismanic) tool” (Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Breyer), provided one recognizes that “asymmetry alone is not a reliable measure of unconstitutional partisanship” and possibly that the standard would be applied only after at least one election has been held under the redistricting plan at issue (Justice Kennedy, joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg). We use this essay to respond to the request of Justices Souter and Ginsburg that “further attention {\ldots} be devoted to the administrability of such a criterion at all levels of redistricting and its review.” Building on our previous scholarly work, our Amicus Brief, the observations of these five Justices, and a supporting consensus in the academic literature, we offer here a social science perspective on the conceptualization and measurement of partisan gerrymandering and the development of relevant legal rules based on what is effectively the Supreme Court's open invitation to lower courts to revisit these issues in the light of LULAC v. Perry.},

The states where a single vote was most likely to matter are New Mexico, Virginia, New Hampshire, and Colorado, where your vote had an approximate 1 in 10 million chance of determining the national election outcome.

We make this argument by (1) examining the current debate over how members of the US House are elected, (2) considering historical trends in the size of House constituencies and comparing them to those of legislatures in other countries, and (3) discussing how increasing the size of the House may lead to better quality representation.},

Despite the plausibility of this argument , there is surprisingly little evidence to support it, and none that estimates the magnitude of the effect controlling for possible confounding variables. We find a strong relationship between candidate familiarity and the congruence of community and district boundaries. Our results suggest differences in the context of elections in the different types of districts; challengers, in particular, are disadvantaged in noncongruent districts. The relationship between congruence and awareness occurs because of the effect of community-district congruence on the structure of the mass media markets. Our results also suggest that the preservation of community boundaries in redistricting merits more attention than the Supreme Court has heretofore given it, and they provide some of the factual evidence upon which future decisions may be based.},

This means not only that the explanations cannot be employed to forecast the situation in the more distant future, but they are inadequate even for short-term analysis. A basis for a longer-term theory of fertility transition is proposed, employing the concept of social structure and demographic behavior adjusting, slowly and after a considerable lag, to each of three modes of production. The focus is on the transition from agricultural to industrial production, especially as this is occurring in the most advanced industrial societies. Three major conclusions are drawn. (1) Unanticipated fertility changes over the last 50 years can be incorporated within a single demographic transition theory. (2) Societal and demographic changes are still at an early stage of their transition to full adjustment to industrialization. (3) The trend, associated with women's participation in the work force, toward below-replacement fertility will continue, but at some stage most governments will probably attempt to raise fertility to replacement level even if the effort is extremely expensive and slows economic growth.},

We define three measures of setup power?winningness, vulnerability, and fragility?and show how they pinpoint the advantages of the candidate who leads in electoral votes of noncompetitive states.

abstract = {This article examines the electoral consequences of variation in voter turnout in the United States. Existing scholarship focuses on the claim that high turnout benefits Democrats, but evidence supporting this conjecture is variable and controversial. Previous work, however, does not account for endogeneity between turnout and electoral choice, and thus, causal claims are questionable. Using election day rainfall as an instrumental variable for voter turnout, we are able to estimate the effect of variation in turnout due to across-the-board changes in the utility of voting. We re-examine the Partisan Effects and Two-Effects Hypotheses, provide an empirical test of an Anti-Incumbent Hypothesis, and propose a Volatility Hypothesis, which posits that high turnout produces less predictable electoral outcomes. Using county-level data from the 1948-2000 presidential elections, we find support for each hypothesis. Failing to address the endogeneity problem would lead researchers to incorrectly reject all but the Anti-Incumbent Hypothesis. The effect of variation in turnout on electoral outcomes appears quite meaningful. Although election-specific factors other than turnout have the greatest influence on who wins an election, variation in turnout significantly affects vote shares at the county, national, and Electoral College levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Political Science Association.},

It suggests that Plato constructed the myth as an account of a search, akin to the sorting of potential philosopher-kings that underwrites the kallipolis ' educational curriculum, for natures that have successfully absorbed the cumulative effects of their philosophical upbringing. The model of nature presented in the myth, in turn, helps us approach the category of nature as a working concept: we can recognize contexts in which it is useful to assume in otherwise complex and fluid individuals a fixed, indelible nature, while granting that our sense of what that consists in is subject to revision.},

abstract = {The distribution of wealth in the United States and countries around the world is highly skewed. How does visible economic inequality affect well-off individuals' support for redistribution? Using a placebo-controlled field experiment, I randomize the presence of poverty-stricken people in public spaces frequented by the affluent. Passersby were asked to sign a petition calling for greater redistribution through a "millionaire's tax." Results from 2,591 solicitations show that in a real-world-setting exposure to inequality decreases affluent individuals' willingness to redistribute. The finding that exposure to inequality begets inequality has fundamental implications for policymakers and informs our understanding of the effects of poverty, inequality, and economic segregation. Confederate race and socioeconomic status, both of which were randomized, are shown to interact such that treatment effects vary according to the race, as well as gender, of the subject. inequality | redistribution | field experiment | political science | taxation T he distribution of wealth in many countries across the globe is highly skewed. In the United States, the gap between the top 1{\%} of earners and everyone else was wider in 2012 than any time since before the Great Depression (1) and is a pervasive social and political phenomenon (2). With this phenomenon comes visible manifestations of inequality, which affect social interactions from cooperation (3) to conflict (4). However, very little is known about how direct exposure to inequality in everyday settings-such as poverty and homelessness in relatively wealthy neighborhoods-shapes human behavior. Isolating this causal effect is challenging because of selective sorting. To overcome this difficulty, I experimentally manipulate exposure to inequality that occurs on sidewalks and street corners. Using a random-ized placebo-controlled field experiment, I show momentary passive "contact" with a poverty stricken person in an affluent public place can change people's willingness to actively support redis-tributive policies. Economic inequality is an abstract concept that is difficult to concretely portray without the help of numbers, graphs, or words. Understanding the implications of exposure to inequality as a personal experience, rather than as an impersonal abstraction, requires the manipulation of microlevel contextual features. I evoke everyday inequality by placing poor individuals in a place of affluence. (Using a separate, online experiment, detailed in SI Appendix, I show that subjects describe images of the poor in affluent settings as depicting inequality. Thus, I use the terms "exposure to inequality" and "poverty in an affluent setting" interchangeably .) Those with the means to live and shop in such neighborhoods are more likely than the average citizen to participate in politics and donate to political causes and thus wield a disproportionate influence over politics and policy (2). The experimental intervention created a microenvironment of inequality that was both highly realistic and carefully controlled by the researcher. In treatment conditions, passersby were subtly exposed to a professional actor (confederate) portraying an impoverished person through both their clothing and body language. In the control condition, the same confederate would portray an affluent individual, dressed business casual and showing appropriately different body language. Since the 1960s, racial attitudes have dominated the Ameri-can public's thinking about poverty (5). Political scientists have shown that simply priming race in a survey can lower white respondents' support for welfare policies (e.g., ref. 6). However , social psychology demonstrates that individuals define themselves in relation to similar others in their environment, such as those who share their race and gender (7). This phenomenon may be particularly relevant in an experien-tial setting. To assess whether predominantly white and well-off pedestrians respond differently to inequality that appears both socioeconomic and racial, confederate race was also randomized. Passersby became subjects in the experiment as they were approached by a petitioner, stationed within 20 feet of the confederate. The policy on the petition was randomized between two texts, the first of which expressed support for a "million-aires' tax" to increase taxation on incomes over {\$}1 million, redistributing the money. To establish a baseline, the other half of subjects were asked to sign a placebo policy petition unrelated to inequality, referring instead to reducing disposable plastic bags. Results from 2,591 solicitations show that individuals are less likely to support redistributive policies in the presence of a poor person in an affluent setting. The finding holds overall and when estimated as a difference-indifferences (net of the baseline response rate established by the placebo petition). The negative causal effect of direct exposure to inequality on support for redistribution appears to be driven largely by white men encountering a poor person of their own race. Significance As the world's population grows more urban, encounters between members of different socioeconomic groups occur with greater frequency. I provide real-world experimental evidence that exposure to inequality shapes decision-making. By randomly assigning microenvironments of inequality, this study builds on observational research linking the salience of inequality to antisocial behavior, as well as survey experimental evidence connecting perceived inequality to diminished generosity. Specifically, I show that exposure to socioeconomic inequality in an everyday setting negatively affects willingness to publicly support a redistributive economic policy. This study advances our understanding of how environmental factors , such as exposure to racial and economic outgroups, affect human behavior in consequential ways.},

This reflects a growing trend worldwide in the use of physical repression to censor online speech. In this paper, we examine the political imprisonment of well-known Saudis to provide the first large-scale, systematic study of the effects of offline repression on online dissent. Analyzing over 300 million tweets and Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content, we find that although repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online, it did not suppress dissent by others. Observing repression increased dissent-including criticisms of the ruling family and calls for regime change-among the followers of those who were imprisoned, and drew public attention to arrested Saudis and their causes. Other prominent figures were not deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent online.},

First, we add 102 studies published between 2002 and 2015 to the initial sample of 83 studies. Overall, we document only minor changes to the original inferences. Second, since different processes might conceivably play at different levels of government, we exploit the larger sample to separately analyse the determinants of voter turnout in national versus subnational elections. We find that campaign expenditures, election closeness and registration requirements have more explanatory power in national elections, whereas population size and composition, concurrent elections, and the electoral system play a more important role for explaining turnout in subnational elections.},

After controlling for other considerations, we find aggregate voter turnout is lower in states with higher index values and self-reported turnout also drops in states with larger index values.},

abstract = {We offer a simple use of Bayes' Theorem to model the relationship between surname and ethnicity in order to improve present expert witness practices in voting rights litigation. Our aim is to show how to better estimate the overall Hispanic share of the electorate to determine realistic opportunity to elect candidates of choice. We show that there is no such thing as the proportion of bearers of a given name who are Hispanic. How ''His-panic'' any given name turns out to be is a function of the overall Hispanicity of the population, which affects both the distribution of names and the conditional probability that the possessor of any given name will be Hispanic. Because of this, the number of names on a surname list (say that of registered voters) that should be counted as Hispanic is not fixed, but rather varies by demographic context. We show how to identify the optimal size of a surname list by balancing false positives and false negatives. We also provide some ''quick and dirty'' approximation methods for estimating the size of an optimal surname list. For example, the optimal number of names needed for a national sample, which is 13.4 percent Hispanic, is roughly 4,300 names. Too many names and you overstate Hispanic population; too few and you understate it. This list of 4,310 surnames , rather counterintuitively, includes all surnames whose holders have more than 34 percent probability of self-identifying as of Spanish heritage on the Census. However, we also show that, despite the existence of both false positives and false negatives, ecological inference of racial bloc voting (RBV) patterns using surname based estimates of the Hispanic share of the electorate at the voting tabulation unit level as the independent variable will usually give us results that are more robust to error in list size than calculations of overall Hispanic levels. In the former case, the two types of error will tend to occur in geographic locations in ways that limit their consequences for the accuracy of RBV estimates.},

The methodology uses five statewide data bases at the precinct level and suitably constructed seats/votes curves. If fairness and responsiveness are valued more than political geography, then they should be made explicit criteria in congressional districting, at least in Pennsylvania.},

Even if the assumptions are relaxed, we show that the front-door and front-door difference-indifferences estimators may be combined to form bounds. Finally, we show that under one-sided noncompliance, these techniques do not require the use of control units. We illustrate these points with an application to a job training study and with an application to Florida's early in-person voting program. For the job training study, we show that these techniques can recover an experimental benchmark. For the Florida program, we find some evidence that early in-person voting had small positive effects on turnout in 2008. This provides a counterpoint to recent claims that early voting had a negative effect on turnout in 2008.},

abstract = {Though African-American and Latino electoral success in state legislative and congressional elections continues to occur almost entirely in majority-minority districts, minorities now have new opportunities in districts that are only 40–50{\%} minority. This success can primarily be explained in terms of a curvilinear model that generates a “sweet spot” of maximum likelihood of minority candidate electoral success as a function of minority population share of the district and the proportion of the district that votes Republican. Past racial redistricting legal challenges often focused on cracking concentrated racial minorities to prevent the creation of majority-minority districts. Future lawsuits may also follow in the steps of recent successful court challenges against racially motivated packing that resulted in the reduction of minority population percentage in a previously majority-minority district in order to enhance minority opportunity in an adjacent non-majority-minority district.},

abstract = {Competition in U.S.House elections has been declining for more than 50 years and, based on both incumbent reelec- tion rates and the percentage of close races, the 2002 and 2004 House elections were the least competitive of the postwar era. This article tests three hypotheses that attempt to explain declining competition in House elections: the redistricting hypothesis, the partisan polarization hypothesis, and the incumbency hypothesis.We find strong support for both the partisan polarization hypothesis and the incumbency hypothesis but no support for the redistricting hypothesis. Since the 1970s there has been a substantial increase in the number of House districts that are safe for one party and a substantial decrease in the number of marginal districts. However, this shift has not been caused by redistricting but by demographic change and ideological realignment within the electorate.Moreover, even in the remaining marginal districts most challengers lack the financial resources needed to wage competitive campaigns. The increasing correlation among district partisanship, incumbency, and campaign spending means that the effects of these three variables tend to reinforce each other to a greater extent than in the past. The result is a pattern of reinforcing advantages that leads to extraordinarily uncompetitive elections.},

abstract = {How can partisan mapmakers enact a partisan gerrymander in the presence of risk-averse co-partisan incumbents who wish to keep most of their constituencies intact? Until now the literature on redistricting has focused on how redistricting affects the geography of partisan support, that is, the underlying partisan balance of electoral districts. We posit that this emphasis on partisanship misses half of the story. Partisan mapmakers have another tool at their disposal: the fostering of population instability that may not affect a district's partisan balance. By examining all redistricting plans enacted in 2001–2002, as well as three case studies, we show that partisan mapmakers strategically foster population instability, which poses problems for incumbents in a way that may not be apparent when looking exclusively at the effects of redistricting on partisanship. Our results show how partisan mapmakers simultaneously achieve two goals: enacting an “optimal gerrymander,” which strengthens some opposition-party incumbents, while inducing instability and reducing the personal vote of those same incumbents. We also show that so-called “neutral” redistricting plans are successful in disregarding incumbency. Finally, our results suggest another mechanism that explains why the 2002 congressional elections in the U.S. produced little competition.},

This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches.

With a combination of county-level, individual-level, and political advertising data, our analysis evaluates the effect of orphan county residency and irrelevant political information on political participation.

We argue that a result of such "flanking" moves, in the early part of the century, has been a shift in emphasis from an underlying social dimension to the economic dimension. In recent decades, electoral salience has shifted back to the social dimension. The net result is that the party cleavage line is much as it was a century ago-but the parties have switched sides.]},

@article{Bangia,
abstract = {We develop methods to evaluate whether a political districting accurately represents the will of the people. To explore and showcase our ideas, we concentrate on the congressional districts for the U.S. House of Representatives and use the state of North Carolina and its redistrictings since the 2010 census. Using a Monte Carlo algorithm, we randomly generate over 24,000 redis-trictings that are non-partisan and adhere to criteria from proposed legislation. Applying historical voting data to these random redistrictings, we find that the number of democratic and republican representatives elected varies drastically depending on how districts are drawn. Some results are more common, and we gain a clear range of expected election outcomes. Using the statistics of our generated redistrictings, we critique the particular congressional districtings used in the 2012 and 2016 NC elections as well as a districting proposed by a bipartisan redistricting commission. We find that the 2012 and 2016 districtings are highly atypical and not representative of the will of the people. On the other hand, our results indicate that a plan produced by a bipartisan panel of retired judges is highly typical and representative. Since our analyses are based on an ensemble of reasonable redistrictings of North Carolina, they provide a baseline for a given election which incorporates the geometry of the state's population distribution. 1. The Will of the People Democracy is typically equated with expressing the will of the people through government. Perceived failures of democracy in representative governments are usually attributed to the voice of the people being muted and obstructed by the actions of special interests or the sheer size of government. The underlying assumption is that the will of the people exists as a clear, well defined voice which only needs to be better heard. Yet the will of the people is not monolithic. It is not always so simple to obtain a consensus or even a clear majority opinion. We rely on our elections as a proxy to express our collective opinions and our political will, which leads to the question, how effective a given election is at capturing this will? In the United States, district representation schemes are used to divide the population into distinct groups, each of which carries a certain amount of representation. This districting acknowledges that the people's voice is geographically diverse and that we value the expression of that diversity in our government. We take election results to represent the people's will, giving the elected officials a mandate to act in the people's name. Hence, it is reasonable to ask if and how this representation is affected by the choice of district boundaries. Just how sensitive are election results, and by extension, our impression of the people's will, to our choices for geographic divisions? The method we use to reveal this will is simple. We take the actual votes cast by North Carolinians at the 2012 and 2016 congressional elections and then change the boundaries of the congressional districts to see how the partisan results of the elections change. Our results show that the will of the people is not a single election outcome but rather a distribution of possible outcomes. The exact same vote counts can lead to drastically different outcomes depending on the choice of districts. compMany discussions of fraudulent elections emphasize voter suppression or voter fraud. However if the results of an election vary so widely over different choices of redistrictings, then it is paramount that the districts employed produce results that are an accurate proxy of the "will of the people." The courts have given some guidance in this direction by promoting the "one person,},

District boundaries delineate which legislative election voters are eligible to participate in, and precinct boundaries identify, in many localities, where voters cast in-person ballots on Election Day. Election officials are tasked with resolving a tremendously large number of intersections of registered voters with overlapping electoral boundaries. Any large-scale data project is susceptible to errors, and this task is no exception. In two recent close elections, these errors were consequential to the outcome. To address this problem, we describe a method to audit the assignment of registered voters to districts. We apply the methodology to Florida's voter registration file to identify thousands of registered voters assigned to the wrong state House district, many of which local election officials have verified and rectified. We discuss how election officials can best use this technique to detect registered voters assigned to the wrong electoral boundary.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The United States does not provide for direct election of its chief executive but utilizes the Electoral College to represent voter choices. Central to this institution is the " winner-take-all " model by which electoral votes in all states but two are awarded to the candidate who garners a plurality of that state's popular vote. As game theorists have long pointed out, this system introduces several biases in voter power that differentially reward or punish voters based on each state's population or electorate. This article offers a historical overview of the Electoral College and the geographic biases in voter power it introduces. It extends the influential binomial model of voter power proposed by Banzhaf in the 1960s to include a multinomial approach sensitive to the presence of more than two parties, the absolute and relative margins of victories, and the number of electoral votes in each state. It then applies this approach to U.S. presidential elections from 1960 to 2004 utilizing a series of cartograms. Next, the article examines voter power differentials between the two major political parties, five ethnic groups, rural and urban areas, and ten religious denominations in the 2000 and 2004 elections.

We examine the geographic distribution of money by states to counties. Cross-sectional analysis shows that counties with relatively more legislative seats per person prior to redistricting received relatively more transfers from the state per person. Over time, counties that lost legislative seats subsequently received a smaller share of state funds per capita. We calculate that population equalization significantly altered the flow of state transfers to counties, diverting approximately {\$}7 billion annually from formerly overrepresented to formerly underrepresented counties, an effect missed by past studies. For those concerned with the design of democratic institutions around the world today, the American experience provides clear evidence of the political consequences of unequal representation.},

It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of LWV for future partisan gerrymandering litigation. In particular, we look toward the applicability of the Pennsylvania court's approach to other potential partisan gerrymandering challenges brought under state law, especially those in the 12 states whose state constitutions have provisions essentially identical to the one relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in states with similar provisions. We pay particular attention to how the court made use of the expert witness testimony in the case, relying on some of it, while rejecting or critiquing the applicability of other elements, since such a discussion can inform future litigation in state courts drawing on the LWV opinion for ideas. In our concluding discussion we contrast the criteria used to evaluate partisan gerrymandering by this court with those used by federal courts, and we look at how it may impact the decisions of legislators about line drawing in 2020.},

These shifts in congressional district populations have implications for representation in Congress that have not been systematically documented. Drawing upon redistricting cycles from 1960 through the most recent cycle in 2010, we compare the districts that have been removed due to population loss or slow growth with the locations that have seen the highest rate of population increase, indicative of the need for new seats. We find that certain populations-namely lower income, minority, and those employed in declining economic sectors-are on the losing end of this seat reallocation process, while other populations-highly mobile, high income and white-are the sources of seat gains. Not only does this research offer a comprehensive look at the demographic considerations that accompany congressional reapportionment, but also considers larger questions of how representation changes in Congress as seat losses and gains accumulate.},

Boix suggests that democratization is likelier when inequality is low, whereas Acemoglu and Robinson argue that democratization is likelier when inequality is at middling levels. Both assume that democratization is a function of autocratic elites' fear of the extent to which a future median voter would redistribute under different levels of inequality. Drawing on contractarian political theory, the authors suggest that democratization is instead a function of demands by rising economic groups for protection from the state. This alternative approach suggests that land and income inequality affect democratization differently: Autocracies with equal land distribution are indeed more likely to democratize, but contrary to the conventional wisdom, income inequality is more likely to promote democratization.},

The impacts of these reforms vary in surprising ways, providing insight into the mechanisms by which states can encourage or reduce turnout. Our theory focuses on mobilization and distinguishes between the direct and indirect effects of election laws. We conduct both aggregate and individual-level statistical analyses of voter turnout in the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections. The results show that Election Day registration has a consistently positive effect on turnout, whereas the most popular reform—early voting—is actually associated with lower turnout when it is implemented by itself. We propose that early voting has created negative unanticipated consequences by reducing the civic significance of elections for individuals and altering the incentives for political campaigns to invest in mobilization.},

@article{Hainmueller2014,
abstract = {The electoral regression discontinuity (RD) design is popular because it provides an unbiased, design-based estimate of the incumbency advantage with few assumptions. However, as is well known, the RD estimate is "local": it only identifies the effect in hypothetical districts with an exactly 50-50 tie between the Democratic and Republican candidates, and does not speak to the size of the incumbency advantage away from this threshold. There is significant uncertainty over the effect of incumbency in districts away from this threshold. Indeed, in a survey of political scientists that we administered, roughly equal numbers of respondents predict the effect to be either larger, smaller, or the same in less competitive districts. In this paper, we follow the method proposed in Angrist and Rokkanen (2013), employing a validated Conditional Independence Assumption that, unlike in typical cases, generates directly testable implications in the context of the RD. This technique allows us to estimate the average effect of incumbency in districts in a window around the threshold as large as 15 percentage points -- i.e., elections in which the winning candidate secured as much as 57.5{\%} of the two-party vote. We find that the incumbency advantage is no larger or smaller in these less competitive districts.},

Derived from the Loosemore-Hanby index, the novelty of DPIx lies in the fact that it synthesizes a proportionality index with a measure of partisan symmetry. I then apply this index to House elections from 1900 to 2016 at the national level as well as in several states, and I also tested it against hypothetical circumstances in which the negative effects of gerrymandering are completely eliminated. The results demonstrate that while gerrymandering is currently producing a pro-Republican bias, this asymmetrical disproportionality has regularly existed in House elections over the past century and was often much more severe. The evidence suggests that short of substantial electoral reform, asymmetrical disproportionality is likely to remain a fundamental characteristic of American electoral politics.},

Throughout, we follow a fundamental principle of statistical inference too often ignored in this literature - defining the quantity of interest separately so its measures can be proven wrong, evaluated, and improved. This enables us to prove which of the many newly proposed fairness measures are statistically appropriate and which are biased, limited, or not measures of the theoretical quantity they seek to estimate at all. Because real-world redistricting and gerrymandering involve complicated politics with numerous participants and conflicting goals, measures biased for partisan fairness sometimes still provide useful descriptions of other aspects of electoral systems.},

abstract = {The foundation upon which accounts of policy-motivated behavior of Supreme Court justices are built consists of assumptions about the policy preferences of the justices. To date, most scholars have assumed that the policy positions of Supreme Court justices remain consistent throughout the course of their careers and most measures of judicial ideology—such as Segal and Cover scores—are time invariant. On its face, this assumption is reasonable; Supreme Court justices serve with life tenure and are typically appointed after serving in other political or judicial roles. However, it is also possible that the worldviews, and thus the policy positions, of justices evolve through the course of their careers. In this article we use a Bayesian dynamic ideal point model to investigate preference change on the US Supreme Court. The model allows for justices' ideal points to change over time in a smooth fashion. We focus our attention on the 16 justices who served for 10 or more terms and completed their service between the 1937 and 2003 terms. The results are striking—14 of these 16 justices exhibit significant preference change. This has profound implications for the use of time-invariant preference measures in applied work.},

We study the consequences of both types of imbalance in a unified theoretical framework building on the notion that voters are rationally ignorant and need to pay costly attention to learn about candidates. Our article rationalizes key empirical regularities such as the existence of large incumbency spending and electoral advantages or the heterogeneous effect of incumbency. Further, we highlight that properly accounting for voter attention is critical to interpreting empirical estimates of key determinants of electoral success, the sources of the in-cumbency advantage, and the causal effect of incumbency status. We also show that, while depressing electoral competition , imbalances nonetheless improve voter welfare.},

Specifically, in Man, the State, and War and Theory of International Politics, Waltz make essentially the same assumptions about human nature as the realists -- that our human natures are fixed, that we cannot trust others, and that decision-makers are rational calculators who seek to promote their narrowly defined self-interests. Moreover, for Waltz, human nature determines world politics as much or more than its anarchic structure. A review of biology, specifically human neuroscience, suggests that these assumptions about human nature, and its relation to world politics, ought to be challenged. Our `natures' are much more complex and flexible than realism and neorealism assumes.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that the role of the U.S. federal judiciary was underspecified and undefined until the era of Chief Justice John Marshall. In contrast, I argue that prior to the Marshall era, the Supreme Court had the specific institutional role of providing an administrative remedy to aggrieved nations to deprive potentially hostile nations of any excuse for belligerence. Specifically, concern among the Framers about this nascent country's absence of dispute resolution mechanisms in the areas of trade and admiralty was critical in the institutional design of the judiciary. Original jurisdiction was designed primarily to remedy trade disputes. The independent judiciary made trade commitments more credible and self-help by the aggrieved less likely. By providing this administrative remedy and lowering the uncertainty associated with trading with revolutionaries, the Framers claimed a seat for the new country at the table of nations. Moreover, enhanced commercial credibility that the administrative avenue for redress provided was instrumental in the early economic development of the United States.},

abstract = {This paper reviews a variety of criteria which have been proposed for legislative and congressional redistricting in the US and discusses the political and legal factors which have shaped 1980s redistricting. Particular attention is paid to the conflicts of interest between incumbents (seeking re-election), party organizations (seeking aggregate partisan advantage), minority interests (seeking proportional minority representation or at least enhanced minority influence), liberal reformers (seeking to take the 'politics' out of the redistricting process), and courts (seeking largely to implement 'one person, one vote' guidelines by minimizing deviation from population equality across districts but also concerned with avoiding dilutions of minority voting strength). It calls attention to three phenomena which have made redistricting in the 1980s different from that of earlier decades: (1) the striking role of the Justice Department in using the pre-clearance provision of the Voting Rights Act to assure greater minority voting strength and to eliminate discriminatory use of multi-member districting schemes; (2) the increased political and legal sophistication of minority groups; and (3) the role of the computer in making available a plethora of districting plans, all of which satisfy court equipopulation guidelines but which differ dramatically from each other in their substantive implications for the representation of political, racial, linguistic, and socio-economic groupings, and in their implications for the likely political fate of incumbent politicians and their potential challengers. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {We measure the persuasive effects of slanted news and tastes for like-minded news, exploiting cable channel positions as exogenous shifters of cable news viewership. Channel positions do not correlate with demographics that predict viewership and voting, nor with local satellite viewership. We estimate that Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position. We then estimate a model of voters who select into watching slanted news, and whose ideologies evolve as a result. We use the model to assess the growth over time of Fox News influence, to quantitatively assess media-driven polarization, and to simulate alternative ideological slanting of news channels. (JEL D72, L82) The 24-hour cable news channels-CNN, the Fox News Channel, and MSNBC-are frequent targets of allegations of media bias. In this paper, we address several questions about cable news. First, how much does consuming slanted news, like the Fox News Channel, change individuals' partisan voting preferences in presidential elections, if at all? Second, how intense are consumer preferences for cable news that is slanted toward their own ideology? After measuring these forces, we ask: how much could slanted news contribute to increases in ideological polarization? And, what do these forces imply for the optimal editorial policy of channels that wish to maximize viewership, or alternatively to maximize electoral influence? The answers to these questions are key inputs for designing optimal public policy-such as merger policy-for the media sector, which has attracted blame for the rise in polarization in the United States (Gentzkow 2016). If consumers simply prefer news that resonates with their pre-existing ideology, and the consumption of such news does not have any associated social or political externali-ties, then the news media sector should be treated like any other consumer product. However, if consuming news with a slant alters the consumer's political behavior,},

A key concern with such aggregation, however, is that changes in the units of aggregation themselves cause difficulty in comparing data gathered on the old boundaries and the new boundaries. Such changes present serious concerns to researchers who may exclude observations or cases due to a lack of comparable units or omit certain key variables. While geographers have long examined this problem and created methods of projecting data from one spatial unit into another, known as areal interpolation,1 it is telling that a recent article notes the difficulty for researchers in implementing even the most basic solutions without relying heavily on programming skills or proprietary software.2 This note makes three contributions toward resolving this problem; first, its accompanying R program allows researchers to easily implement two simple-but flexible-methods of areal interpolation in any context for which the relevant spatial representations (shapefiles) exist. Second, it applies these methods to a specific set of variables that are widely used in political science (electoral results) and confirms that the methods produce generally accurate results using real data gathered from six heterogeneous countries (Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Germany, New Zealand, and the United States). Third, it runs Monte Carlo simulations to examine the performance of the methods given violations of the assumptions about the underlying distribution of the variables of interest.},

There are, however, alternative explanations for these priming findings, alternatives that previous studies have not fully considered. In this article, I reanalyze four cases of alleged priming, using panel data to test priming effects against these alternatives. Across these four cases, I find little evidence of priming effects. Instead, campaign and media attention to an issue creates the appearance of priming through a two-part process: Exposing individuals to campaign and media messages on an issue (1) informs some of them about the parties' or candidates' positions on that issue. Once informed, (2) these individuals often adopt their preferred party's or candidate's position as their own.},

Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment conditions in which they were urged to vote through direct mail or face-to-face canvassing. Compared to a control group that received no contact, the treatment groups were significantly more likely to vote in 1998. The treatment groups were also significantly more likely to vote in local elections held in November of 1999. After deriving a statistical estimator to isolate the effect of habit, we find that, ceteris paribus, voting in one election substantially increases the likelihood Of voting in the future. Indeed, the influence of past voting exceeds the effects of age and education reported in previous studies.},

The impact of partisanship on voting behavior in congressional elections has also increased markedly, albeit more recently and to a level still well below that of the 1950s.

Redistricting is treated as a combinatoric optimization problem that is constrained by compactness rules. Computer models are used to analyze the results of applying compactness standards when political groups are geographically concentrated. Several population models are used to generate populations of voters, and arbitrary plans are created with combinatoric optimization algorithms. We find that compactness standards can be used to limit gerrymandering, but only if such standards require severe compactness. Compactness standards are not politically neutral—a geographically concentrated minority party will be affected by compactness standards much differently than a party supported by a geographically diffuse population. The particular effects of compactness standards depend on the institutional mechanism that creates districts.},

Second, theories of racial priming have not adequately accounted for both an increasingly racialized political climate and increased tolerance for explicit anti‐minority appeals. In two survey experiments fielded both before Trump's rise and after his presidential victory, we find the Implicit‐Explicit (IE) model always fails for anti‐black appeals, sometimes fails for anti‐immigrant appeals, but consistently holds for anti‐Latino appeals. While we find the null effects of implicit versus explicit anti‐black and anti‐immigrant appeals are partly driven by tolerance for the explicit appeals, we also find evidence that white Americans are adept at recognizing the racial content of appeals featuring widely used, congruent issue‐group pairs. Our findings shed light on conditions under which the IE model does and does not hold in the current political era.},

It did so entirely on state law grounds after a three-judge federal court had rejected issuing a preliminary injunction against the plan. The aim of this essay is to examine the implications of LWV for future partisan gerrymandering litigation. In particular, we look toward the applicability of the Pennsylvania court's approach to other potential partisan gerrymandering challenges brought under state law, especially those in the 12 states whose state constitutions have provisions essentially identical to the one relied upon by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and in states with similar provisions. We pay particular attention to how the court made use of the expert witness testimony in the case, relying on some of it, while rejecting or critiquing the applicability of other elements, since such a discussion can inform future litigation in state courts drawing on the LWV opinion for ideas. In our concluding discussion we contrast the criteria used to evaluate partisan gerrymandering by this court with those used by federal courts, and we look at how it may impact the decisions of legislators about line drawing in 2020.},

abstract = {Nearly all US residents live in metropolitan areas of various sizes and densities. Even most of "rural America" lives within "metropolitan America," in close relationships of daily social and economic interchange with adjacent urban areas. The spatial distribution of these metropolitan nodes of settlement and activity does not correspond to the territorial boundaries that organize the US system of political representation. I argue that this mismatch poses two problems for the legitimacy of related US institutions: a form of malapportionment in which residents of different metropolitan areas arbitrarily receive different kinds of representation and a form of political fragmentation that frustrates local self-government and perpetuates distributive injustice on a national scale. I contend that these problems justify consideration of constitutional reform that would establish metropolitan regions as a principal unit of territorial constituency formation for purposes of political representation and democratic self-rule.},

abstract = {We present a statistical test to detect that a presented state of a reversible Markov chain was not chosen from a stationary distribution. In particular, given a value function for the states of the Markov chain, we would like to show rigorously that the presented state is an outlier with respect to the values, by establishing a [Formula: see text] value under the null hypothesis that it was chosen from a stationary distribution of the chain. A simple heuristic used in practice is to sample ranks of states from long random trajectories on the Markov chain and compare these with the rank of the presented state; if the presented state is a [Formula: see text] outlier compared with the sampled ranks (its rank is in the bottom [Formula: see text] of sampled ranks), then this observation should correspond to a [Formula: see text] value of [Formula: see text] This significance is not rigorous, however, without good bounds on the mixing time of the Markov chain. Our test is the following: Given the presented state in the Markov chain, take a random walk from the presented state for any number of steps. We prove that observing that the presented state is an [Formula: see text]-outlier on the walk is significant at [Formula: see text] under the null hypothesis that the state was chosen from a stationary distribution. We assume nothing about the Markov chain beyond reversibility and show that significance at [Formula: see text] is best possible in general. We illustrate the use of our test with a potential application to the rigorous detection of gerrymandering in Congressional districting.},

Funding types received by districts may depend on their legislators' party identity when party preferences differ. Estimates from the United States, using fixed-effect and regression-discontinuity designs, indicate that states represented by members of Congress in the majority receive greater federal grants, especially in transportation, and defense spending. States represented by Republicans receive more for defense and transportation than those represented by Democrats; the latter receive more spending for education and urban development.},

abstract = {Turning out to vote is the most common and important act of political participation in any democracy. Voting is also less well understood and explained empirically than other political acts engaged in regularly by citizens. Turnout, however, presents a special problem for rational choice theories of politics, for it is taken to be the paradigmatic example of the problem of collective action, in which, although all may benefit from voting, it is rarely in the individual's self-interest to vote. This paper begins by examining the problem of explaining turnout. A basic form of rational choice models of turnout is developed-basic in the sense that it is common to all such models. This basic model is shown to be incomplete, and the two most important models, the calculus of voting and the minimax regret model, are illustrated as alternative ways to complete this basic model, along with mention of game-theoretic models. Their strengths and weaknesses are then assessed. The remainder of the paper argues that rational choice accounts of turnout are possible. The first step is to argue that turnout is not an especially problematic version of the collec- tive action problem because it is, for many, a low cost, low (expected) benefit decision. A "strategic politicians" account of turnout and campaigns is examined next. A reinterpre- tation of the intrinsic benefits of voting is then considered and is used to examine the most important substantive problem in the turnout literature, its decline. These steps, I argue, make theories of ordinary political decisions at once both more political and more integrated into the politics of the larger system.},

But does the method by which states draw legislative districts affect partisan competition in the elections that are held in these districts?

Specifically, we evaluate the effects on competition of legislative, judicial, and commission redistricting plans enacted prior to the 1992 and 2002 congressional elections. We find that more competitive elections occur when courts and commissions are directly involved in the redistricting process, as opposed to when redistricting is handled only in the state legislative process.},

The procedure uses an adjusted normal partisan vote (ANPV) measure to determine the number of seats that the preferred party would receive when the vote is equally divided between the parties and how that distribution of seats would change as the ANPV is adjusted up or down.

abstract = {We look at the problem of devising an optimal gerrymander from the standpoint of the political party in control of the redistricting process in a single-member district system involving two-party competition. In an electoral universe with uncertainty, we show that the optimal partisan gerrymander is different from the classic recipe for partisan gerrymandering if parties are concerned with the long-run risk of electoral defeat caused by shifting electoral tides. We look at two different plausible objective functions: (1) maximizing expected seat share: and (2) maximizing the probability of a (working) legislative majority. In general, the optimal districting schemes which will be generated under these two objective functions will be different, although both will make similar use of the two basic gerrymandering techniques, the concentration gerrymander and the dispersal gerrymander. Also, because of the need to minimize risk, both will resemble a bipartisan gerrymander considerably more than has previously been suggested in the literature. We also look at difficulties in achieving either objective (1) or objective (2) because of conflicts between majority party legislators' own self-interest and the districting that will maximize party advantage, and briefly review evidence that the 1982 California congressional plan was a risk-minimizing partisan gerrymander. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

Less attention has been given to the effect of other institutions on the party system, particularly strong presidents. Analyzing election results in postcommunist Europe, the authors find support for Duverger's law after controlling for the strength of the executive. They argue that strong presidents substantially reduce the incentive for parties to seize control of the legislative agenda. Hence, the restraint that electoral systems exercise on the proliferation of parties and independent candidates is weakened. The authors find that a further consequence of strong presidents is that the incentive for majority control of committees and the legislative agenda is weakened.},

The main conclusions are (1) there is strong evidence that the economy affects all three vote shares and in remarkably similar ways; (2) there is no evidence of any presidential coattail effects on the on-term House elections; (3) there is positive serial correlation in the House vote, which likely reflects a positive incumbency effect for elected representatives; and (4) the presidential vote share has a negative effect on the next midterm House vote share, which is likely explained by a balance argument.},

In equilibrium, provision is sensitive to the degree of social mobility, theoretically linking social mobility to public consumption. Further, empirical puzzles about the impact of voting franchise extensions on the growth of government spending are addressed within the context of social mobility.},

@article{Tesler2015b,
abstract = {Prior research provides limited insights into when political communications prime or change citizens' underlying opinions. This article helps fill that void by putting forth an account of priming and opinion change. I argue that crystallized attitudes should often be primed by new information. An influx of attention to less crystallized preferences, however, should lead individuals to alter their underlying opinions in accordance with prior beliefs. Since predispositions acquired early in the life cycle-such as partisanship, religiosity, basic values, and group-based affect/antagonisms-are more crystallized than mass opinion about public policy, media and campaign content will tend to prime citizens' predispositions and change their policy positions. Both my review of previous priming research and original analyses presented in this study from five new cases strongly support the crystallization-based account of when mass opinion is primed or changed. I conclude with a discussion of the article's potential political, methodological, and normative implications.},
