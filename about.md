# About Jonathan Cervas
</div>

I am **Jonathan Cervas**, Assistant Teaching Professor in the Institute for Strategy and Technology (Political Science) at Carnegie Mellon University, where I teach graduate and undergraduate courses on American politics, research methods, representation, and voting rights. I am also a Research Associate with the Electoral Innovation Lab at Princeton University and a contributor to the non-partisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

My research and professional work focus on political institutions, elections, redistricting, and voting rules. I have published eleven peer-reviewed articles in leading journals across political science, geography, economics, and law, including *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *Political Geography*, *Social Science Quarterly*, *Public Choice*, and the *Election Law Journal*. I have presented invited talks at Princeton University, the University of Houston, Albany Law School, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and numerous other venues. I also serve as a referee for major journals in my field.

## Public Service and Redistricting Work

I have extensive experience serving as a court-appointed special master, consultant, and expert witness in redistricting and voting rights cases. My appointments have included:

## Academic Background

I joined Carnegie Mellon University in 2020 as a postdoctoral fellow after earning my M.A. and Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Irvine. My doctoral dissertation, *A Quantitative Assessment of the Electoral College, 1790–2020*, examined the historical and statistical dimensions of presidential elections. I hold a B.A. from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
