**How a Mapmaker Became New York’s Most Unexpected Power Broker**
*The New York Times*

Jonathan Cervas, a Pittsburgh-born postdoctoral fellow and independent redistricting expert, was appointed as special master to redraw New York’s congressional and state senate maps after the Democratic-drawn maps were struck down as unconstitutional. His maps, praised by Republicans and anti-gerrymandering groups but criticized by Democrats, have upended the political landscape by forcing tough primaries and reshaping minority representation in New York City. Though thrust into the spotlight, Cervas insists he was simply applying the law and serving democracy, not politics.

**Jonathan Cervas’ quest to make government represent the voters**
*Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*

Jonathan Cervas, a postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon, has quickly risen to prominence as a redistricting specialist, playing key roles in both Pennsylvania’s legislative maps and New York’s high-stakes congressional and state senate redrawing. Trained under noted scholar Bernard Grofman, Cervas emphasizes fairness, neutrality, and voter empowerment, viewing redistricting as both art and science in balancing competing democratic values. Though criticized by some politicians, he sees his work as vital to protecting undiluted votes and strengthening democracy at a moment when gerrymandering and partisan manipulation threaten it.

**What to know about Bernard Grofman and Jonathan Cervas, Wisconsin's new map consultants**
*Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*

Bernard Grofman, a UC-Irvine political scientist, and Jonathan Cervas, a Carnegie Mellon postdoctoral fellow and redistricting expert, were appointed by the Wisconsin Supreme Court to review and possibly redraw the state’s legislative maps. Both are regarded as nonpartisan specialists with extensive experience in redistricting cases across the country, including Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New York. Tasked with ensuring population equality, compliance with the Voting Rights Act, and neutrality regarding partisan advantage, they could recommend adjustments to submitted proposals-or create their own maps—though their role has sparked criticism from some justices who argue the decision hands too much power to unelected outsiders.

**Who is the man tasked with redrawing New York’s new district lines?**
*City & State New York*

Jonathan Cervas, a Carnegie Mellon postdoctoral fellow and redistricting expert, was appointed by a New York court as special master to redraw the state’s congressional and senate maps after the previous ones were struck down. Though not widely known, he brings extensive experience from redistricting work in Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Georgia, where he earned praise for fairness and technical skill. This marks his first time leading the process solo, and his academic background in political science and mapping technology underscores his reputation as a nonpartisan specialist focused on strengthening democracy.

**New York’s Redistricting Master Holds Key to Congressional Power**  
*Bloomberg Government*  

Jonathan Cervas was appointed by a New York court as special master to redraw the state’s congressional and state Senate district lines after the Democratic-drawn maps were struck down. With a tight deadline and high national stakes-since New York’s maps could influence control of the U.S. House-Cervas is tasked with producing constitutionally sound, ostensibly neutral districts that will last a decade. Drawing on his background working on redistricting cases in several states under renowned expert Bernard Grofman, Cervas is widely described by scholars, advocates, and attorneys as nonpartisan, technically skilled, and attentive to legal constraints and public input. While his past work has not satisfied all political actors, observers largely expect him to act as an “honest broker,” consistent with the broader pattern of court-appointed special masters producing relatively fair maps.

  - *Cervas also criticized both parties for revisiting maps for political gain in ways that could leave voters with fewer competitive districts in which to cast votes. "The people are losing. Every time we gerrymander for partisan gain, voters are worse off," he added. "A minus plus a minus is a bigger minus."*

  - *Incumbents also don’t like losing voters who have supported them or getting wholly new communities drawn into their districts, said Jonathan Cervas, who teaches redistricting at Carnegie Mellon University and has drawn new maps for courts.*
  - *Cervas said that’s why it was striking to watch Trump push Republicans to dive into mid-decade redistricting. “The idea they’d go along to get along is basically crazy,” he said.*

  - *Even without the Voting Rights Act, Cervas said, there is no way for Republicans to make that Memphis seat red. If they scattered the city's voters among neighboring GOP-heavy districts, they might make those competitive.*
  - *He said some other GOP-controlled states, such as Missouri and South Carolina, are in similar binds with their lone, heavily Democratic seats that were drawn to comply with the voting law. Others, like Georgia, are so politically competitive that it’s likely Republicans couldn't erase a Democratic seat in one part of the state without jeopardizing one of their own.*
  - *Still other GOP-controlled states, such as Mississippi, may have an easier time eliminating their lone Democratic, Voting Rights Act-mandated seat. And in larger states such as North Carolina and Florida, Republicans would have a freer hand to redraw the maps to favor their party without having to preserve majority-minority seats held by Democrats.*

  - *Jonathan Cervas, a redistricting expert at Carnegie Mellon University, ran data from past elections in Utah against the redrawn map and found that Democrats would lose every time. That indicates that the map is uncompetitive, he said.*  
  *“Although it’s not as competitive as I think the plaintiffs would want, I think it’s far better than the map that currently exists - a stark improvement,” Cervas said.*

  - *“There’s one special reason why there’s not going to be anything in Pennsylvania, and that’s because Pennsylvania is one of only, I think, two states in the country that has a divided government,” said Jonathan Cervas, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in redistricting and voting rights. “There’s been a stalemate on even passing the basic state budget. So the idea that we would have an agreement from both branches of the legislature and the governor on a new redistricting plan seems very unlikely – exceedingly unlikely.”*  
  - *“You could imagine that maybe Republicans pick up a couple of seats in the House, and they're running a formidable candidate for governor, Stacy Garrity. She could win, and then they would have a united government,” Cervas said. He added that such a dynamic in Harrisburg could change the appetite for exploring the possibility of a new map in the middle of the decade. However, that scenario wouldn’t be feasible until after the 2026 midterms, and redrawing congressional districts before then would do little to help vulnerable incumbents.*
