            <h2 id="sec:intro">Why do we have an Electoral College</h2>
            <p>
                The racist history of the founding of the United States is well traversed. American political institutions were established explicitly linking the perceived worth of an individual - landed white males being of highest value, enslaved blacks being the lowest - to the power derived from the institutions. The explicit implication of a system designed with such discrimination in mind was that equality was not the goal of the founding. Indeed, equality or other words indicating such theory is not found in the U.S. Constitution until Amendment XIV, which was not added until 1868.
            </p>
            <p>
                No doubt, however, that the Constitution does provide for some forms of equality. The U.S. Senate was established to give a voice to the states, and Article V says that "no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived its <em>equal</em> Suffrage in the Senate" (Emphasis added). Indeed, regardless of its population size, each state received two senators. During the Continental Congress, which we have a good record of thanks to Thomas Jefferson (VA) through his personal notes, the treatments of states received a great deal of debate. Samual Chase (MD): ''Mr. [Samuel] Chase observed that this article was the most likely to divide us... that the larger colonies had threatened they would not confederate at all if their weight in congress should not be equal to the numbers of people they added to the confederacy''. Delegates of large states preferred voting in proportion to numbers. John Adams (MA) explained that if the contribution of state A is &pound5, state B &pound50, and state C &pound500, what sense does it make to for each to have equal representation. <footnote>These monatary values are taken from Adam's example.</footnote> Stephen Hopkins (RI) made the observation that there were four large states, four small states, and four middle sized states. The four largest stated contained the inhabitants of more than half of all twelve states. James Wilson of Pennsylvania thought it strange that simply affixing the term ''State'' to a colony entitled it to equal representation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But population itself, or its relevance to apportionment, posed its own set of disagreements among the founders. The lower house of congress would be made to represent the people proportionally in legislative districts. The American Revolution was essentially a war for representation, rooted in the believe that there can be no taxation without representation. Apportionment, the process by which fractional proportions of the population are translated into whole numbers of legislative districts, involves at least three important questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, how many districts will be created. This is answered originally in the U.S. Constitution (Art. I, Sec. 2) by the mathematical formula $total population/30,000$, and each state will have a minimum of one representative. <footnote>In an 11<sup>th</sup> change, this ratio went from 40,000:1 to 30,000:1. It was subsequently amended over time as the total U.S. population (and number of states) increased, eventually frozen at 435 members in 1929.</footnote> The closer the ratio of legislators per person is to 1:1, the less malapportionment that will exist. This problem will be taken up in section one of this dissertation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, by what method do proportional fractions get translated into whole numbers. <footnote>This too has changed over time between five different methods. The methods each propose a different formula, which in turn affected whether large or small states benefited.</footnote> This problem has been extensively investiated in the academic literature, including the well known Alabama Paradox, and will not be rehashed here<cite id="BalinskiYoung1974, GrofmanScarrow1981, BalinskiYoung2001, Edelman2015">(Balinski and Young 1974; Grofman and Scarrow 1981; Balanski and Young 2001; Caulfield 2010; Edelman 2015)</cite>. I will briefly explore the paradox of malapportionment in section one. This paradox happens when an institution has an increase the equality of voters but a measure of malapportionment shows a decrease in equality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, and perhaps most important in regards to the Constitutional Convention and eventual adoption of the Constitution, was who to be counted for the purpose of apportionment. Even today, debate still lingers about whether all residents, regardless of their legal status, should be counted, in the late 1700s, the debate turned on how to count slaves. Southern states benefited when slaves were counted fully, and thus advocated including slaves in the counts. Northern states, despite largely anti-slavery, preferred if slaves did not count at all for the purpose of apportionment. Southern delegates had no intention of allowing slaves to vote, but wished to increase their representation in the national congress. Northerns, on the other hand, knowing that slaves would be denied the franchise, believed that they should therefore be excluded from apportionment, which would lead to increased representation of northern, non-slave states.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the population debate had two cleavages; first, large states and small states each benefited from different balance of power mechanisms, while the northerners and the southerns had a different set of interests. These were not perfectly overlapping sets, since the largest population states existed in both the slave south and the non-slave north. For instance, Virginia, despite its Southern location, was the largest state by population in 1790. But it also had a very large slave population. Not including slaves in the apportionment population would have left it with a population just slightly larger than Pennsylvania. Contrast that to small northern states with little or no slave populations such as Vermont, Delaware, and Rhode Island, and the small southern states such as Georgia and Kentucky. <footnote>The median state was Connecticut. The average population of northern states was 225,032; the Southern average was 309,332.</footnote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Needless to say, apportionment caused much debate between the states, which eventually required compromises. Among these compromises was a fusion between the Virginia Plan (a large state, which called for a bicameral legislature where representation was based either on population or on wealth) and the New Jersey Plan (a small state, which called for each state to have equal representation in congress, mirroring the institutional arrangement established Articles of Confederacy, though not necessarily the voting rules.) The Connecticut (the median population state) Compromise <footnote>Called at the time the 'Great Compromise'.</footnote> created a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the lower house and equal representation for the states in the upper house.
            </p>
            <p>
                This still left the fraught issue of how to count population. Approximately one-half of the population of Southern states were enslaved <cite id="RansomSutch1979">(Ransom and Sutch 1979)</cite>. At the time of the debates about the institutional structure of the U.S., a large proportion of economic prosperity in the South relied on slavery <cite id="RansomSutch1988">(Ransom and Sutch 1988)</cite>. <footnote>By at least one estimate, slave capital by 1859 was 44 percent of all capital in the in five major cotton-producing states. Physical capital not including real estate was less than 10% <cite id="RansomSutch1988">(Ransom and Sutch 1988)</cite>.</footnote> Northerners, who had wished to abolish slavery but failed, wanted apportionment population to be based on the free population. Southerns would walk away from the union if slavers were excluded. The three-fifths compromise was agreed on between the two sides. This necessary, though unfortunate, compromise made the Constitutional possible. As an editorial note, the proportion three-fifths seems like it was destined based on the math described earlier. In 1790, the union would consist of fifteen states, split between five southern and ten northern states. Taken as blocks, the South was set to have ten out of the total 30 U.S. Senators (30%) with 40% of the population, while the North would have the other 70% (with 60% of the population). In the lower chamber, leaving aside the exact apportionment method which was still yet to be determined, the South would receive between 34 and 43 seats of the total 105 (32% to 41%). Under the three-fifths compromise, the South would receive 40 (38.1%) of the lower chamber seats. Had only free persons been included in apportionment, the South would have received just 32% of the seats with 40% of the total population. There was also a recognition that the South would grow faster than the North. In 1800, Tennessee was added, giving the slave states two additional U.S. Senators (now 37.5%) with 43% of the population and 40.4% of the house seats. And while the northern population outpaced the southern population in subsequent decades, the relative number of southern states outpaced northern states, which increased southern representation in the U.S. Senate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given all the diliberation on the legislative branch, why did the founders create the Electoral College (EC)? It should be clear by now that the institutional deign in the United States result from a series of compromises between competing interests. We know that the EC is a blend of the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives. The simple answer to why the EC is that the same agreements that produced the legislative institutions coalesced again to create the the mechanism for electing the president. In the sense that the EC mechanically operates as the House plus the Senate, it would be fair to assume that the founders were simply pleased with the compromises made that lead to the House and Senate that little more discussion was needed. There was far less attention paid to the election of the president during the Constitutional Convention than to the institutional design of the legislative branch. It might be deem the EC is the institution that nobody wanted. It was not advocated by any state, created as a compromise, or even faced much resistance. Madison's notes from the Federal Convention of 1787 indicate a debate about whether the executive be elected by the legislature, from one of its members, if the executives of the states would choose a national executive, if it were to consist of just one or more people, whether it should be little more than a person to carry out the wishes of the legislature, and of the duration of the term. But there was little debate about the process by which they be elected, or the consequences of the many choices. Benjamin Franklin (PA) seemed distracted by the question of Executive compensation. Others were worried that just a handful of states could force upon their choice. Still others worried that they would retain a constituency in the legislature that would allow them to lead by tyranny.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was little appetite for an executive that bore resemblance to the king. Indeed, much of the debate was not about the best system for finding the best candidate to be Executive, but rather an exercise in choosing a system that would convey confidence among the people, limit the power of the individual who would head the Executive, ensure that no state could dominate the appointment, was a national figure, and that the Executive not become a monarchy. The strong opinions that shaped the debate about the structure of the legislature did not dominate the debate on choosing the Executive. <footnote>Outside of the choice between an Executive appointed by the legislature versus one chosen by the people (or indirectly by the people through Electors).</footnote> James Wilson (PA), according to Madison's notes, was apprehensive about suggesting the executive be elected by the people, though it was his preference. Roger Sherman (CT) thought that any independence of the executive to be the very essence of tyranny. Suffice to say that focus for the founders on the executive laid on the scope of its power and constituency to which it would be loyal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first motion to introduce Electors was by Mr. Wilson on June 2nd, 1787 <cite id="Farrand1911_vol2">(Farrand 1911b, pg. 73, 75)</cite>. His reasoning was simply that it would produce more confidence among the people if the Executive was not elected by legislature, or with connection to the State legislatures. Mr. Elbridge Gerry (MA) liked Wilson's proposal <cite id="Farrand1911_vol2">(Farrand 1911b, pg. 76)</cite>, but was not sure that the people should act directly in the choice of Electors. He thought State legislatures should nominate, and Electors choose from those nominated. In this way, the people themselves would not be choosing the president, but rather indirectly through their representatives, who themselves would be independently represented. Indeed, this is quite similar to how the EC operated in the first few cycles after the Constitution was ratified. Even today, state legislatures retain some independence in choosing the slate of Electors that differs from the direct will of the voters <cite id="Foley2019; Hasen2020_ElectionMeltdown">(Foley 2019, Hasen 2020)</cite>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One proposal (July 19, 1787) that got a great deal of attention was that the Executive be chosen by Electors, determined by a ratio of where states with populations less than 100,000 would receive one Elector, those with populations between 100,000 and 200,000 would receive two Electors, and all others would receive three. It passed in the affirmative 8-2, though not ultimately being adopted. <footnote>Subsequent motions were made for slightly different proportions receiving one, two, or three electors.</footnote> But again, these motions were made for the mode of election, not the process that would produce the votes of the Electors. Another proposal (July 24th, 1787, <cite id="Farrand1911_vol2">(Farrand 1911b, pg. 83)</cite> would have selected Electors by lot from the national legislature; suppose there be 90 legislators from which 25 Electors be selected. 90 balls, 65 of one color and 25 of another, would be drawn by members of the legislature.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first serious proposal presented to the full set of delegates of what would become the Electoral College came on September 4 <cite id="Farrand1911_vol2">(Farrand 1911b, pg. 394)</cite>. By this time, the full Constitution would be signed within two weeks, and there was yet no system in place for electing the executive. Up until this point, most of the debate was on what type of power the Executive would have, and whether it would be appointed by the legislature or by the people (or alternatively by the states). By early September, however, the type of congress was now generally agreed, along with the presumption that the Executive would be elected not by the legislature, and not by the people directly, but through a middle process of Electors. The task of planning the design of the election process of the national Executive as given to a group colloquially called the ''Committee of Leftovers''. This "Committee of Eleven" reported that the Executive would be chosen by Electors which would equal one for each Senator and one for each member of the House. In this proposal, States would select Electors where at least one of the two people from which the Electors would transmit must not be from the state of the Elector. The person with the majority of votes would be President, while the person receiving the second most votes would be Vice President. Even here, questions about what happens if no candidate receives a majority still lingered.
            </p>
            <p>
                As its name suggest, it happened after all other 'important' business had concluded. As the process of writing the Constitution closed, delegates stated their objections to the text as written. Many delegates contested the apportionment of the House, suggesting it too small. Others objected to the proportion needed to overturn a presidential veto. <footnote>There was debate about the presidential pardon, particularly when it came to treason; it was argued that the Executive should have the right to pardon treason, and if he himself was guilty, he be impeached and tried in the Senate.</footnote> Elbridge Gerry (MA) objected to the three-fifths clause, instead desiring that only freeman be enumerated. Benjamin Franklin (PA) perhaps had the most eloquent statement, explaining that he disapproved of many of the parts of the Constitution, but that in his old age he had learned that he often was wrong about things, and that he would defer to his fellow delegates. Of all the shortcomings of the proposed Constitution, one not mentioned was the election rules for the president. If it indeed is the institution no one wanted, it also was the institution no one opposed. Long after the Constitution had been ratified, and later the Twelth Amendment augmenting the rules for electing the Executive, Madison wrote about the mood at the convention. He reminisce "[T]he final arrangement of it took place in the latter stage of the Session, it was not exempt from a degree of the hurrying influence produced by fatigue and impatience in all such Bodies" <cite id="Farrand1911_vol3">(Farrand 1911c, pg. 588)</cite>. <footnote>James Madison To George Hay, August 23, 1823.</footnote>

                Justice Elena Kagan's majority opinion in <em>Chiafalo v. Washington</em> 591 U.S ___ provides a useful overview of the hisorical origins and actual operation of the Electoral College. By way of background on the case, Electors from Washington <footnote>And in Colorado, where the lower court was in disagreement with the lower court in Washington, leading to the U.S. Supreme Court granting certitori.</footnote> in 2016 who had been pledged to support Hillary Clinton were 'faithless' and instead cast their ballots for another person. At issue was whether the state could penalize the Electors for not supporting the Elector they pledged to support. In a 9-0 opinion, the court ruled that the Constitution allows states to impose conditions on Electors based on Article II, §1 that authorizes States to appoint Electors "in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct." The opinion goes on to explain that the common practice beginning even with the first election was for Electors to cast their ballots according to the votes of the state. In the earliest elections, the States' Electors were mostly chosen by the State legislature's majority party. By 1832, however, all states but South Carolina choose their Electors by popular vote <cite id="PeirceLongley1981">(Peirce and Longely 1981)</cite>. The Twelth Amendment addressed early issues with voting for President as drafted in the Constitution which made ties go to the House of Representatives very likely when political parties nominated two individuals to run as a team. Since the Twelth Amendment was ratified on June 15, 1804, there have be no subseqent changes in the Constitution for electing the Executive. States have sometimes changed the way they appoint Electors, wuch as Nebraska and Maine, who currently appoint electors based on the popular vote winner of the Congressional district from which the Elector represents (and two at-large based on the state-wide popular vote winning candidate). Other states have returned infrequently to state legislative appointments. The names of electors do not generally appear on the ballot, evn though in all states eletions for president are only indirectly taken with Electors doing the actual balloting <cite id="Albright1940">(Albright 1940)</cite>. There was a historical presumption that Electors need not be identified since they were obligated to vote as instructed by the voters. <footnote><em>Ray v. Blair</em> 343 U.S. 214 (1952).</footnote> As Kagan describes it, the Constitution is "barebones about electors" <em>Chiafalo v. Washington</em> 591 U.S. ___ (slip op. at 10). Despite many reform efforts nationally, the EC has remained much the same as conceived during the early days of the Republic.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final edits of constitution were drafted with little by way of objection to the system for electing the president. Months of debate over precise wording of provisions outlining the U.S. House and Senate, the judiciary, and other important institutions of governance had created an exasperation over the process. Going through historical records will not yield letters from esteemed statesmen advocating for a system of Electors equal to the number of representatives plus the number of senators. The framers did not use terms like 'bias' to describe impurities in their institutions; however, they were acutely aways that the choices they made would have consequences. The ink was barely dried before problems began to arise. These ambiguities and flawed systems nearly lead to an early collapse of this young system of government. After two uncontested presidential elections in which George Washington was elected, his refusal of the third term lead to the first contested election. By this time, two major political parties had formed. In the end, John Adams won a narrow victory over Thomas Jefferson, who became Vice President (even though they were bitter rivals). Four years later, in 1800, the still fledgling democracy experienced its first electoral crisis. Brought on by a shortsighted and imprecisely worded provision in Article II, the President was elected by a majority of Electors, and the Vice President the runner up in the contest. But what if the top two challengers are able to finish with the same total? Since each Elector was to vote for two individuals, if each Elector who votes for one candidate as their top choice also chooses for their second choice the same person as all others, they both end up with the same amount. This is precisely what happened when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr (both Democratic-Republicans) received the same number of votes from the Electors. The Democratic-Republican plan was for one Elector not to vote for Burr such that Jefferson would win and Burr would finish in second. The failure to execute this plan created a crisis, and it became clear that the framers had failed to envision the creation of political parties, coalitions between candidates, and strategies to manipulate the vote. The crisis was nearly exploded because the House was controlled by the Federalists, who had wished the election to remain deadlocked since their candidate, John Adams would not be re-elected. The election was settled in the House of Representatives on the 36th ballot when Alexander Hamilton convinced several Federalist to back Jefferson over Burr.
            </p>
            <p>
                This led to the passage of the XXII Amendment (and also Hamilton's death, as Burr eventually killed him in a duel). The lesson to be had from this crisis is that people respond to institutions, not vis versa. And it is the institutions that I study here. By most accounts, the constitutional convention did not take seriously the mechanics of the system of Electoral College. It is not even clear what objective the framers sought in creating the Electoral College or if they seriously entertained the idea of bias or manipulation, whether by political means or structurally. They had believed the president would be a consensus pick, and created an institution that would reflect that. When instead political parties created anger, disagreement, and polarized into factions, the first system designed in the constitutional convention failed. The potential flaws, such as risk of inversion, malapportionment, or other types of biases that result from an Electoral College that were not addressed at the constitutional convention also seem to escape the debate in the 8th Congress which ratified the XXII amendment (see however Foley (2019) who argues that the 1803 fix of the Electoral College provisions were a "product of extensive and erudite dilberations". See also Hawley (2014 @Hawley2013) who contends that the twelth amendment was transformative for the presidency, not meerly a mechanical fix.). If the metric of success is stability, indeed it worked as intended since no changes have been made to the institutional arrangement of the EC (Foley does not agree that it has worked as intended, and rather argues that it has lost the majoritarian principles in which it was established.). Setting aside the thoughts of those who drafted the twelth amendment, it is clear that even there fix to the originally drafted provisions still allow for an institutional arrangement with potential flaws including non-majoritarian outcomes, inducing campaign incentives to focus on just a handful of battleground states, and weighing voters from different states differently. The twelth amendment failed to address what many view as fundamental flaws.

            <p>
                The fixes found in the twelth amendment hardly left the EC without controversal elections. Besides the well-known fight over the 2000 election, the election of 1876 is arguably the most disputed of all time. As election day returns filled telegraphs, it was clear that Democratic candidate and New York Governor Samual J. Tilden had a large popular vote lead, over 250,000 votes. By the end of election day, Tilden had secured 184 electors, while Hayes was sitting at 165. That left 20 disputed. Tilden was just one shy of an electoral majority. One elector that Hayes had rightfully won in Oregon was disqualified because he held a federal job, which made him constitutionally ineligible. Three other states were 'too close to call', and reports were aplenty about intimidation at the polls and apparent outright fraud. The disputed electors led to the four states submitting dueling slates of electors. The constitution was unclear as to how the votes would be counted in a circumstance in which had unsettled slates. In Oregon, a Democratic governor attempted to replace the Hayes elector who was disqualified with someone who would instead vote for Tilden, which would have ensured his victory. Eventually, a 15-man election commission was established that included five members from each the House, Senate, and Supreme Court, evenly split with one member from the Supreme Court widely viewed as independent. After the independent justice had to step down from the commission after being appointed Senator from Illinois, he was replaced by the next most independent of the remaining justices. In the end, he voted in lock-step with the Republican members of the commission, where each disputed state was delivered on party line 8-7 votes for Hayes.

                An additional complication of the 1876 election was that Colorado had been officially admitted into the union in August of 1876, and it's first act as a state was to appoint electors for Hayes. No votes were cast for president in Colorado. Had Colorado not been admitted to the Union months before the election, Tilden would have secured both the popular vote and the presidency, but since Colorado's legislature chose Hayes' electors for it's three votes, Tilden was denied a majority. In return for ending reconstruction in the South, the 20 electors were released to vote for Hayes, giving him the presidency with a minority of popular votes. Rutherford B. Hayes, unpopular after the contest, did not run for re-election in 1880.

                In 1876, Colorado's electors were selected by the legislature, a practice that dates back to the founding but hardly ever used after the Civil War. It's total population was less than 40,000, so there is no chance that the votes from Colorado could have affected the inversion. Without Colorado's EC votes, however, there would have been no inversion and Samual Tilden would have been declared the winner. Of course, given that the election result was a product of the Great Compromise of 1877, it's futile to speculate as to what deal would have been struck had the circumstances been slightly different. We use the vote for governor held a month before the November presidential election as a proxy for the popular vote in Colorado in 1876. John L. Routt was the elected Republican governor who defeated Bela M. Hughes (14,154 to 13,316).

                This dissertation is not intended as a lesson on history as read from notes. Nor is it intended to revisit the founder's intentions. Rather, it is a comment on history as gleaned from the records of apportionment, votes, and institutions. This attempt is to classify the system for electing the president not on the merits which were debated in 1787, but by the standards of equality in which we recognize in the 21st century. But it is on this very question on which this dissertation will largely focus; is the Electoral College a system that provides for the fair election of the Executive, giving voice to the people in an equal way. To this end, I have assembled three essays that contribute to answering this question. Collectively, they allow for a limited if not specialized evaluation.

                In the first chapter, I look at the period beginning with the first apportionment after the ratification of the Constitution and end with the most recent apportionment under the 23rd Census. The section casts several measures of equality from law, political science, and economics to measure deviations of proportionality between voters and representation. This was of central concern, as stated above, for ratification. The Electoral College is compared to the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate (the two components which combine to make the EC). I find that the EC, regardless of the measure used, is far closer to the equality found in the House than that found in the Senate. This finding is consistent across measure and over time. I will also speak to the best measures for comparing disproportionality. Among the seven different measures used, each has several properties that make them more or less useful at measuring the relative equalities of institutions. I will additionally use a constructed dataset from the U.S. House in the antabellum period to point out one paradox which makes measures most typically used by courts unreliable as overall summaries of equality.

                The second chapter addresses questions about how different states influence the EC results. Specifically, it is often said that battleground states, where the vote share between the two main competing parties is closely contested, are the only votes that decide the election outcome. In this section, I show that battleground states, while clearly having an importance in the selection of the president, do not hold the exclusive providence of importance. Non-competitive states create the conditions under which states become pivotal, but that condition becomes of equal importance in setting the stage for the battlegrounds. Thus, a candidate can not count solely on the battleground states for its election. Indeed, knowing the difference in proportion of the EC seats in which each party holds as Non-Competitive, what I call the Non-Competitive Advantage, allows for the prediction of the eventual winner with great accuracy. From that view, it is actually the non-competitive states that have the most influence on the election.

                In the final chapter, using election results from 1868 to 2016, I take into consideration that the institutional makeup of the Electoral College leads to different outcomes. In this section, I pay particular attention to one detail of geographic-based institutional arrangements that tends to cause frustration and is seen as a sign of inequality - electoral inversions. An inversion happens when the candidate who wins the most votes overall fails to win the election. Measuring the election outcomes under several sets of institutional arrangements, I find that under all systems inversions happen, though which elections in which they happen fluctuates. Even in the most proportional system that uses an elector-based voting mechanism occasionally leads to inversions.

                I will conclude by supplementing these three sections with additional analyses that help to put into context the Electoral College as an institution that leads to [un]fair appointment of the president. Additionally, I will provide some commentary on the future of the EC, specifically focusing on the 2020 election
